However, it is unclear how carbonated silicate melts are formed. Here, we report whole-rock major and trace element, and Mg-Zn-Fe isotope, and in situ olivine and clinopyroxene Mg isotope data for peridotites and pyroxenites in Cenozoic alkaline basalts from Shulan and Yitong, Northeast China, to reveal the formation mechanisms of carbonated silicate melts. As residues of the primitive mantle, most of the Shulan and Yitong (spinel) harzburgite and lherzolite have relatively lower δ26Mg and higher δ66Zn than the mantle values, and show LREE-enriched patterns. These features indicate that these peridotites have been modified by carbonated silicate melt, transforming them into carbonated peridotites. The Shulan websterites exhibit metasomatic textures, and most of their whole-rock and in situ δ26Mg values are lower than the mantle values, which also supports the presence of a carbonated lithospheric mantle. The Yitong cumulate orthopyroxenites, representing silica-rich melts, have lower δ26Mg and higher δ66Zn values than mantle peridotites, implying that recycled carbonate has been involved in these silica-rich melts. The Yitong cumulate wehrlites and (olivine) websterites display major element compositions similar to those of carbonated peridotite melts, coupled with low whole-rock and clinopyroxene δ26Mg values, high δ66Zn and δ57Fe values, indicating the occurrence of carbonated silicate melts. The transition from orthopyroxenites to (olivine) websterites is marked by the decreasing of their whole-rock δ26Mg, δ57Fe values and Zn/Fe ratios and increasing of their δ66Zn values, along with decreasing of their crystallization temperatures, suggesting that silica-rich melts were gradually transformed into carbonated silicate melts via continuous interaction with carbonated peridotite.

With more than 0.7 million tonnes (Mt) of Zn reserves at average grades ranging from 4–8%, the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field comprises representative deposits such as those of Caiyuanhe, Heli, and Qingshuitang. The ore bodies, which exhibit stratiform, vein-like, and lenticular forms, are hosted within the Cambrian Qingxudong Formation dolomite and are spatially associated with the NE-trending Mandong fault. This Zn ore field in Southwest China is a classic example of Zn-rich mineralization. However, the genetic mechanisms and processes responsible for the Zn-rich nature of these MVT Pb‒Zn deposits remain poorly understood. This study aims to characterize Zn mineralization in the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field, Southwest China. The rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol2) from the syn-ore stage vary between 5.63 and 32.50 ppm (with an average of 14.07 ppm), whereas in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol3) from post-ore stage, the values range from 45.63 to 95.69 ppm (with an average of 72.03 ppm). The fluid inclusions of Dol2 and Dol3 exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 98–204°C (with an average of 143°C) and 98–195°C (with an average of 132°C), with corresponding salinity ranges of 13.0–29.5 wt% (with an average of 20.9 wt%) and 16.0–25.7 wt% (with an average of 18.9 wt%) NaCl equivalent, respectively. Sphalerite inclusions exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 95–230°C (with a mean of 143°C) and salinities ranging from 13.8–28.9 wt% (with a mean of 23.7 wt%) NaCl. The δ 13 C fluid , δ D fluid , and δ 18 O fluid values of the ore-forming fluids range from -4.4‰ to -3.8‰ (with a mean of -4.1‰), -36.4‰ to -27.8‰ (with a mean of -31.9‰), and 4.9‰ to 5.7‰ (with a mean of 5.3‰), respectively. In this study, an Fe- and Zn-enriched NaCl-H₂O basement brine is identified as the ore-forming fluid responsible for the Zn-rich MVT deposits. During its low- to medium-temperature migration, the fluid was channelled by the Mandong fault and Wangsi anticline structural framework, which provided ideal pathways and traps. During migration, the fluid leached sulfur (reduced from evaporites to H 2 S) from wall rocks and ultimately precipitated within dolomite faults and fractures. The distinct Zn-rich character of the deposits stems from the following two key factors: a primary derivation from the Zn-rich basement of the Yangtze Block and a chemical preference for Zn enrichment, which is driven by the differing fractionation coefficients of Zn- and Pb-chloride complexes in the NaCl–H 2 O system.

This work presents a case study from the Mikir Hills, NE India, utilizing zircon U-Pb geochronology, mineral chemistry, and geochemical thermodynamic modeling constraints to understand the origin and relationship of ca. 508 Ma high-K monzogranites, granites, and HSGs.

The redox calculations (ΔNNO −0.3 to −0.1) and thermometry results (∼880−902 °C) using amphibole chemistry show oxidized and high-temperature conditions for monzogranites. The monzogranites’ high K2O and large-ion lithophile elements suggest the role of a sediment-derived enriched mantle source in their origin. The rhyolite-MELTS and Magma Chamber Simulator modeling results suggest the monzogranites’ parental melt resulted from a silicic metasomatized phlogopite-stabilized lithospheric mantle wedge that underwent subsequent lower crust assimilation. The polybaric (∼6−4 kbar) crystallization of the generated assimilated melt formed the monzogranites with plagioclase and K-feldspar as the dominant crystallizing phase (&gt;50%). Plagioclase-melt equilibrium tests yield slightly higher liquid-only saturation temperatures than plagioclase-liquid pairs, indicating progressive crystallization and melt extraction. The rhyolite-MELTS geobarometer suggests the highly felsic melts separated from the crystal mush between ∼3.8 kbar and 2.8 kbar and emplaced at subvolcanic levels as failed rhyolite eruptions.

To explore the distribution and substitution mechanisms of trace elements in key minerals and clarify the deposit’s genesis, LA-ICP-MS was employed for in situ analysis of trace element compositions in sphalerite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite from different stages. In sphalerite, trace elements including Fe, Mn, Cd, Co, In, and Ag are mainly integrated into the mineral lattice through isomorphism. In pyrite, Co and Ni are primarily incorporated via coupled substitution, while in chalcopyrite, In, Ag, and Sn are predominantly integrated through coupled substitution. The Co/Ni ratio and As content in pyrite suggest the mineral formed in a medium- to low-temperature environment, with temperatures decreasing as mineralization advanced. The Ga/In and Zn/Cd ratios in sphalerite indicate its formation under medium- to low-temperature conditions, with higher temperatures during the main mineralization stage.

In order to improve the fit of model dynamic topography compared to observations, in this study, we include chemical density anomalies in Earth's lithosphere to model geoid and dynamic topography. We also combine these anomalies with lateral viscosity variations and study the effect on predicted dynamic topography and geoid and investigate which density models would yield a good fit.

Here, we present whole-rock geochemical and Ba–Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic data for basalts from the sediment-rich Luzon Arc and the sediment-poor Bicol Arc to constrain the recycling processes of fluid mobile elements (FME) in different subduction settings. Our results suggest that the mantle wedge beneath the Luzon and Bicol arcs was primarily metasomatized by melts from subducted sediments and fluids from subducted oceanic crust, respectively. The basalts from both arcs show variable δ 138/134 Ba values despite their limited variations in Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopes, reflecting the heterogeneous dehydration of phengite in subducted sediments and oceanic crust, which have undergone different extents of Ba isotopic fractionation at shallow depths. Luzon back-arc basalts (BAB) exhibit Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic compositions similar to those of island arc basalts (IAB), yet possess more variable and lighter Ba isotopic compositions. This defines a distinct Ba isotopic lightening trend across the arc, reflecting progressive Ba isotopic fractionation associated with enhanced phengite dehydration at increasing subduction depths. The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts.

The widespread occurrence of fluorine-bearing minerals (e.g., fluorite, fluorapatite, and bastnäsite) in carbonatites indicates that their parent magmas are rich in fluorine. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which fluorine controls REE and Nb mineralization remain unclear. Building on previous work, we systematically synthesize the regulatory role of fluorine in REE and Nb mineralization throughout the entire magmatic evolution of carbonatites. Our key findings are: (1) during partial melting, fluorine decreases the solidus of carbonated peridotite, thereby enhancing the generation and stability of carbonatitic melt. (2) In the mantle melting stage, it lowers the partition coefficients of REE and Nb between mantle minerals and melt, effectively promoting their extraction. (3) Throughout magmatic crystallization, fluorine significantly enriches REE and Nb in the residual melt. (4) During liquid immiscibility, fluorine exerts limited influence, as the partition behaviors of REE and Nb are primarily governed by structural differences between the conjugate melts.

Associated mafic to intermediate dikes and stocks (adakites and calc-alkaline basalts to andesites) attest to the presence of mafic magmas in the shallow crust during batholith assembly and imply anomalously hot conditions in the mantle that are attributed to rupture or rollback of the subducting slab. Field, geochemical, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data support generation of the ferroan magmas at midcrustal depth by melting of calc-alkaline plutonic rocks or by protracted differentiation of a parental basalt, and production of the I-type magmas by partial melting of gabbroic rocks at greater depth. Metasomatism by fluids bearing Na, F, and high field strength elements enriched some ferroan rocks to produce peralkaline granite. Mixing between the I-type and ferroan magmas also produced a hornblende-biotite granite with rapakivi feldspars, which is the most voluminous phase of the batholith. Results of this study suggest that ferroan granitoids rarely form in continental arcs because that tectonic regime limits voluminous basalt intrusion into the upper crust, and not because of a lack of suitable source rocks.

It has been suggested that continental intraplate alkaline magmas undergo early sulfide saturation. However, there is a lack of evidence linking erupted magmas to their cumulative counterparts. We examined the petrography and chalcophile and platinum group element (PGE) geochemistry of sodic and potassic differentiation lineage lavas and cumulate autoliths from The Pleiades, an intraplate alkaline volcanic field in northern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The presence of sulfide minerals and depleted PGE contents in mafic lavas show they were saturated in sulfide from the initial stages of magma differentiation. The sodic lineage lavas and their kaersutite gabbro autoliths have abundant sulfides associated with fractionation of titanomagnetite and kaersutite. Their presence is consistent with the chalcophile element geochemistry of the lavas. In the potassic lineage lavas, petrography of autoliths indicates that the sulfides are more abundant in kaersutite diorite than wehrlite, olivine essexite, olivine diorite, and syenite autoliths. Kaersutite is not a phenocryst phase in the potassic lineage but crystallized via in situ replacement of the precursor olivine and augite. During the kaersutite formation, sulfides were precipitated from the interstitial silicate melt. The melt was sulfide oversaturated due to temperature decrease, and compositional variations (mainly SiO2, ΣFeO, Fe3+/ΣFe ratio). The mantle-like isotope compositions of Cu, Zn, and S in the potassic lineage confirms a magmatic origin of the sulfides. The magmatic sulfides from The Pleiades are characterized by depleted PGE, Au and Cu contents. Fractional crystallization models show that early sulfide saturation led to impoverishment of chalcophile metals in The Pleiades magmatic system. This phenomenon may be common in continental intraplate alkaline magmas ascending through thick crusts.", "authors": ["Jihyuk Kim", "Mi Jung Lee", "Jong Ik Lee", "Philip R.

Their formation is not well understood due to low silica solubility in carbonatite melts and negligible amounts of silicate minerals on carbonatite melt cotectics at upper crustal conditions. We explore whether silicocarbonatites can be thought of as antiskarns: rocks formed by leaching of SiO 2 from siliceous wall rocks by carbonatite melts, and its deposition as solid silicate minerals by reaction with chemical components already present in the carbonatite melt. Solid state thermodynamic modelling at 1–5 kbar and 500–800 °C predicts that calcite–dolomite–magnetite assemblages will transform to dolomite-free silicocarbonatites with an increase in silica contents. In sodic systems, the formation of aegirine and alkali amphiboles suppresses silica activity despite elevated silica contents. Therefore, dolomite remains stable, but Fe 3+ is consumed, firstly from magnetite breakdown, and secondly by coupled Fe oxidation and reduction of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 , and graphite, particularly at higher pressures. Despite a net increase in Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ , the system evolves to increasingly lower oxygen fugacity. In aluminous systems, nepheline indicates high temperatures whereas alkali feldspars form at lower temperatures. Modelling of potassic systems demonstrates stability of mostly phlogopite-rich biotites, leading to Fe 2+ increase in all other carbonate and silicate phases. We find that perthites are expected in high pressures whereas two feldspars are more likely in lower pressures. Aspects of the clinopyroxene natural compositional trend (diopside to hedenbergite to aegirine) of carbonatite systems can be explained by silica contamination. Ferrous clinopyroxenes typically require low alumina and are predicted in potassic or low temperature sodic systems, primarily at mid to high pressures. Silica contamination permits the formation of silicocarbonatite-like assemblages in a way that is not limited by SiO 2 solubility in carbonatite melts. Glimmerites and clinopyroxene-rich rocks (such as the ijolite series) that often occur around carbonatite rocks at the contact with silica-oversaturated wall rocks can be explained as the extreme end of silica contamination of carbonatite melts. Therefore, these clinopyroxenites and glimmerites can form solely via metasomatic processes without the presence of a silicate melt.", "authors": ["Michael Anenburg", "Jesse B.

The mass fractionation caused by instrumental mass discrimination was corrected by a combination of internal correction using Sr as an internal standard (coming from a NIST SRM 987 standard solution) and external correction using a matrix-matched standard. Several important instrument parameters were investigated, such as the effect of the addition of N 2 and “wet” plasma condition, the mass fractionation behaviors between Zr isotopes and Sr isotopes, the position effect in laser ablation cell and the effect of laser ablation parameters (laser spot size and energy density). The Zr isotope compositions of seven zircons (GJ-1, 91500, Plešovice, Rak-17, Paki, Aus and Mala) were determined by the developed fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). Our fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS results for Zr isotope compositions agreed with TIMS analyses within analytical uncertainties, indicating the presented method is a suitable tool to resolve isotopic zoning in natural zircons. The results also suggest that GJ-1, 91500, Plešovice, Paki, Aus and Mala had the homogenous Zr isotope composition and could be considered as the potential candidates for the Zr isotope analysis in zircons, except Rak-17 which presented the large Zr isotope variation.", "authors": ["Wen Zhang", "Zhaochu Hu", "Lanping Feng", "Zaicong Wang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Yantong Feng", "Hong Liu"], "doi": "10.1007/s12583-021-1535-7", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12583-021-1535-7", "published": "2022-02-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Earth Science", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "通过飞秒激光剥蚀 MC-ICP-MS 结合“湿”等离子体技术精确测定锆石中的锆同位素比值", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在评估飞秒激光烧蚀多接收器电感耦合等离子体质谱（fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS）在锆石中锆同位素分析的应用。", "methodology": "采用fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS结合Sr内标和基质匹配外标校正质量分馏，并优化了N2添加、“湿”等离子体、激光参数等仪器条件。", "key_findings": "fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS的锆同位素结果与TIMS一致，表明该方法适用于天然锆石同位素分区研究，并发现GJ-1等六种锆石具有均一的锆同位素组成。", "innovation": "创新性地将“湿”等离子体技术应用于飞秒激光烧蚀MC-ICP-MS，结合Sr内标和外标校正，实现了锆石中锆同位素比值的准确测定。", "relevance_note": "该方法为天然锆石的锆同位素分区研究提供了准确工具，并筛选出潜在的锆同位素分析标准物质，对地球科学研究具有重要意义。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1007/s12583-021-1605-x", "title": "Advances in Isotope Geochronology and Isotope Geochemistry: A Preface", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Xiangkun Zhu", "Zaicong Wang", "Huayong Chen"], "doi": "10.1007/s12583-021-1605-x", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12583-021-1605-x", "published": "2022-02-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Earth Science", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "同位素地球年代学和同位素地球化学进展：序言", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在概述同位素地球年代学和地球化学领域的最新进展。", "methodology": "本文通过综述和介绍特刊论文，总结了同位素地球科学的进展。", "key_findings": "本文强调了同位素地球年代学和地球化学领域的重要突破和新兴趋势。", "innovation": "创新点在于系统总结了同位素地球科学前沿进展，并指明未来研究方向。", "relevance_note": "本文为同位素地球科学研究者提供了最新进展概览和未来研究指导。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.07.016", "title": "Carbonated sediment recycling and its contribution to lithospheric refertilization under the northern North China Craton", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Chunfei Chen", "Yongsheng Liu", "Stephen Foley", "Mihai N.

However, how cratonic roots remain stable for billions of years and become remobilized later is still not well understood. The eastern North China Craton (NCC) is the best region to illuminate this issue because of its well-known lithospheric thinning and decratonization during the Mesozoic–Cenozoic. The thinning mechanism is debated because of limited constraints on the thermal-chemical conditions (lithology and P–T–H2O–fo2) of the Archean lithospheric mantle before and during its removal. Here, we provide constraints on these thermal-chemical conditions for the Archean lithospheric mantle beneath the eastern NCC during its extensive thinning in the form of whole-rock chemical and Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic compositions and mineral (especially olivine) chemistry of the Early Cretaceous primitive basalts (MgO > 10 wt.%) from Yixian and Sihetun in the western Liaoning Province. Our data support a model in which the Yixian and Sihetun basalts were derived from metasomatized Archean lithospheric mantle under shallow (∼50–60 km), hot (∼1,290–1,350 °C) conditions. This indicates the existence of a relict (∼25 km) of the Archean lithospheric mantle during the Early Cretaceous, supporting gradual or episodic erosion of the eastern NCC lithospheric mantle. Furthermore, the NCC lithospheric mantle was not only widely rehydrated (>1,000 ppm H2O) but also highly oxidized (Δlogfo2FMQ=+1.5∼+1.9 at 1.7–2.0 GPa) during its extensive thinning. Such rehydration and oxidization are demonstrated to be closely related to wet upwelling from the Mantle Transition Zone (MTZ) triggered by the deep subduction of the Paleo-Pacific oceanic slab in the period ∼200–125 Ma. We emphasize that the water released from the upwelling MTZ component and associated hydrous melt influx played a key role in the lithospheric thinning of the eastern NCC by oxidizing the lithospheric mantle and lowering its melting point, which led to redox melting, promoting the erosion of cratonic lithosphere. Our study provides key evidence for the role of deep volatile cycling from the MTZ in modifying thermal-chemical conditions and in the lithospheric thinning of cratons.", "authors": ["Xianlei Geng", "Stephen Foley", "Yongsheng Liu", "Zaicong Wang", "Zhaochu Hu", "Lian Zhou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.epsl.2019.03.012", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2019.03.012", "published": "2019-04-03T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Earth and Planetary Science Letters", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "华北中生代岩石圈地幔的热化学条件及其对克拉通岩石圈减薄的启示", "domain": "构造地质学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "探讨克拉通岩石圈地幔的稳定与改造机制，特别是华北克拉通东部中生代岩石圈减薄的机制。", "methodology": "分析辽宁义县和四合屯早白垩世原始玄武岩的全岩化学、Sr-Nd-Pb同位素和矿物（橄榄石）化学，以约束岩石圈地幔的热化学条件。", "key_findings": "华北克拉通东部岩石圈地幔在减薄过程中广泛水化和氧化，与古太平洋洋壳深俯冲引起的MTZ湿上涌有关，水和熔体导致氧化熔融，促进了岩石圈侵蚀。", "innovation": "首次提供了地幔转换带（MTZ）深部挥发物循环在改变克拉通岩石圈热化学条件和减薄中的关键证据。", "relevance_note": "该研究为理解克拉通岩石圈地幔的改造机制和深部地球动力学过程提供了关键证据和新模型。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1016/j.epsl.2019.115971", "title": "Sulfide-bearing cumulates in deep continental arcs: The missing copper reservoir", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Kang Chen", "Ming Tang", "Cin‐Ty A.

Whether these variations are the consequence of nebular processes, planetary volatilization, differentiation or late accretion is still unresolved. The element mercury is the most volatile of the MVE and is a strongly chalcophile element. It is one of the few elements that exhibit large mass-dependent (MDF) and mass-independent (MIF) isotopic fractionations for both odd (odd-MIF, Δ199Hg and Δ201Hg) and even (even-MIF, Δ200Hg) Hg isotopes in nature, which is traditionally used to trace Hg biogeochemical cycling in surface environments. However, the Hg isotopic composition of Earth and meteorites is not well constrained. Here, we present Hg isotopic data for terrestrial basaltic, trachytic and granitic igneous samples. These rocks are isotopically lighter (δ202Hg = −3.3 ± 0.9‰; 1 standard deviation) than sedimentary rocks that have previously been considered to represent the terrestrial Hg isotope composition (δ202Hg=−0.7±0.5‰; 1 standard deviation). We show degassing during magma emplacement induces MIF that are consistent with kinetic fractionation in these samples. Also presented is a more complete dataset for chondritic (carbonaceous, ordinary and enstatite) meteorites, which are consistent with previous work for carbonaceous chondrites (positive odd-MIF) and ordinary chondrites (no MIF), and demonstrate that some enstatite chondrites exhibit positive odd-MIF, similar to carbonaceous chondrites. The terrestrial igneous rocks fall within the range of chondritic compositions for both MIF and MDF. Given the fact that planetary differentiation (core formation, evaporation) would contribute to Hg loss from the silicate portion of Earth and would likely fractionate Hg isotopes from chondritic compositions, we suggest that the budget of the mantle Hg is dominated by late accretion of chondritic materials to Earth, as also suggested for other volatile chalcophile elements (S, Se, Te). Considering the Hg isotopic signatures, materials with compositions similar to CO chondrites or ordinary chondrites are the most likely late accretion source candidates. Finally, eucrite meteorites, which are highly depleted in volatile elements, are isotopically heavier than chondrites and exhibit negative odd-MIF. The origin of volatile depletion in eucrites has been vigorously debated. We show that Δ199Hg versus Δ201Hg relationships point toward an equilibrium nuclear field shift effect, suggesting that volatile loss occurred during a magma ocean phase at the surface of the eucrite parent body, likely the asteroid 4-Vesta.", "authors": ["Frédéric Moynier", "Jiubin Chen", "Ke Zhang", "Hongming Cai", "Zaicong Wang", "Matthew G.

Gold deposits, characterized by quartz lode or disseminated styles of mineralization with extensive alteration of wall rock, of the Jiaodong Peninsula and Liaodong Peninsula are underlain by rocks of similar geological settings characterized by uplifted blocks of metamorphosed Archean and Proterozoic rocks surrounded by relatively unmetamorphosed Mesoproterozoic rocks and Mesozoic granitoid plutons. The huge order-of-magnitude difference in reserves between the Liaodong gold province (500 t) and the Jiaodong gold province (5000 t) attract the attention of geologists. Different C–H-O-S-Pb isotopes and isotopic dating have sparked controversy over the source of the gold deposits. In this study, we conducted integrated analyses of zircon U-Pb dating, bulk-rock compositions, mineralogical compositions and high-precision gold analyses on a series of meta-clastic sedimentary rocks from the Paleoproterozoic Liaohe Group in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, North China Craton, of which the Au analyses reveal Au mobilization during prograde metamorphism. In the Gaizhou Barrovian-type metamorphic zone, the bulk-rock Au contents of samples within various metamorphic zones show a monotonic decrease up-temperature, from 2.09 ppb in the chlorite zone to 0.07 ppb in the sillimanite zone. The evolution in Au content during prograde metamorphism of other formations are identical to that of the Gaixian Formation. The Au concentrations of biotite in different metamorphic zones show little variation ranging from 0.66 to 0.35 ppb, whereas the Au concentrations of muscovite in different metamorphic zones mainly decrease from 2.60 ppb in the chlorite zone to 0.57 ppb in the sillimanite zone with increasing metamorphic grade in samples without metallic sulfides. Coincidently, there is a dechlorination process in biotites during regional metamorphism. Chlorine, released by metamorphism, may have played a vital role in the migration of Au, which could absorb onto muscovite and other minerals, during prograde metamorphism. Given an Au content of 4.67 t/km3 in the chlorite zone rock approximately equivalent to the protolith, metamorphism up to upper amphibolite grade would force the rocks to release 52% of the Au in the Gaizhou Barrovian-type metamorphic zone. Taking into account previous studies in the interpretation of our results, we propose that Precambrian rocks, such as the meta-clastic sedimentary rocks of the Gaixian Formation, may have contributed considerable amounts of Au to the Liaodong gold province. The Liaohe Group releasing large amounts of Au during Paleoproterozoic metamorphism, may thus provide the primary Au enrichment for the Mesozoic gold deposits.", "authors": ["Weilong Cui", "Jinghui Guo", "Guangyu Huang", "Zaicong Wang", "Yanhong Liu", "Jin‐Hui Yang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104624", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104624", "published": "2021-12-02T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Ore Geology Reviews", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "碎屑沉积岩进变质作用过程中的金活化：以华北克拉通胶辽吉带辽河群为例", "domain": "矿床学与成矿", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文探讨胶辽吉带辽河群变质碎屑岩在进变质作用中金的迁移机制及其对金矿成因的贡献。", "methodology": "采用锆石U-Pb定年、全岩和矿物成分及高精度金含量分析，研究辽河群变质碎屑岩。", "key_findings": "进变质作用使全岩金含量随变质程度升高而下降，释放52%金，黑云母脱氯作用可能促进金迁移。", "innovation": "定量揭示进变质作用中金的显著迁移，提出氯气释放是金迁移关键，为金初次富集提供新机制。", "relevance_note": "为胶辽吉带金矿来源提供重要证据，揭示前寒武纪岩石作为中生代金矿初次富集源的潜力。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1016/j.scib.2023.09.045", "title": "Rb-Sr isotopes record complex thermal modification of Chang’e-5 lunar soils", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Yiheng Li", "Zaicong Wang", "Wen Zhang", "Lian Zhou", "Keqing Zong", "Lanping Feng", "Jiawei Li", "Qi He", "Zhenbing She", "Xiang Wu", "Zhaochu Hu", "Long Xiao", "Yuanbao Wu", "Yongsheng Liu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scib.2023.09.045", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2023.09.045", "published": "2023-10-04T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Science Bulletin", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "Rb-Sr同位素记录了嫦娥五号月壤的复杂热改造作用", "domain": "行星科学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在利用Rb-Sr同位素揭示嫦娥五号月壤的复杂热改造历史。", "methodology": "研究采用了Rb-Sr同位素分析技术对嫦娥五号月壤样品进行详细测定。", "key_findings": "Rb-Sr同位素记录显示嫦娥五号月壤经历了复杂的热改造过程。", "innovation": "首次通过Rb-Sr同位素系统性地揭示了嫦娥五号月壤的复杂热历史。", "relevance_note": "该研究为理解月球表层演化、撞击事件和热历史提供了重要地球化学证据。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1021/acs.analchem.1c04497", "title": "Isotopic Analysis by Laser Ablation Solution Sampling MC-ICP-MS─An Example of Boron", "abstract": "Using boron as a test analyte, laser ablation (LA) solution sampling multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) is proposed and validated as a fast method for isotopic analysis in natural liquids and digested samples without any prior purification process. We demonstrated that the solution reference standard can be used as a bracketing standard for in situ δ<sup>11</sup>B analysis in solids. Based on a sensitivity enhancement of 8- to 9-fold, all testing solutions were diluted in a 5% (v/v) NH<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O instead of classical 2% (v/v) HNO<sub>3</sub>. With a discrete and minimal sample solvent loading by the LA sampling strategy, it produces nearly \"dry\" plasma conditions that tolerate the sample matrix remarkably. The memory effect, one of the most difficult challenges in boron analysis, was dramatically eliminated with only 15 s wash time; thus, each analysis took less than 100 s. No significant matrix effects were observed for varying 50-100% boron concentrations in the samples and varying 20-60% NH<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O matrix used for the dilution, as well as for samples doped with a 1/100 synthetic seawater matrix.

To determine precise and accurate silver isotopic data in silicates, we have modified the traditional pretreatment procedures, assessed isobaric interference and matrix effects, and analyzed silver isotopic compositions in silicates. By modification of the silicate digestion and ion-exchange procedures, efficient elution of silver was achieved. The doping experimental results indicated that the matrix effect induced by Ti and Cr could be satisfactorily corrected using the internal standard Pd isotope pair of 108Pd–106Pd. The modified chemical chromatographic method effectively separates Ni from Ag in silicate samples, thereby minimizing the significant isobaric interference from Ni cations. As a result, the shifts in the δ109Ag value caused by cations can be corrected to less than 0.02‰. There are considerable shifts down to −0.82‰ in δ109Ag from the accepted δ109Ag value when soluble metasilicate is present in the solution, which might explain the discrepancies in measured δ109Ag values for silicate materials. To accurately analyze silver isotopic compositions, especially of silicates with extremely low silver abundance, a silver standard doping method with an optimum doping proportion (sample-to-standard material ratio of 2:8) has been shown to produce an acceptable measurement uncertainty from 0.04 to 0.06‰ (2SD). The high-precision δ109Ag value determined in this study for ultramafic rocks from Balmuccia and the basalt reference material, BHVO-2, of −0.044 ± 0.062‰ is consistent with that of −0.16 ± 0.07‰ reported by previous studies.

The significant range of δ 65 Cu in mantle peridotites thus could be ascribed to recycled crustal materials and/or oxidative mantle metasomatism. However, the influence of normal magmatic fractionation processes on δ 65 Cu variations remains poorly understood, and it is unclear whether the magmatic processes also lead to large δ 65 Cu variations in mantle rocks. To address the issue, we present bulk‐rock δ 65 Cu of fresh mantle pyroxenites from the Balmuccia peridotite massif, Northern Italy. These pyroxenites formed by melt‐peridotite reaction and mineral accumulation from MORB‐ to OIB‐like, sulfide‐saturated basic magmas. Mass balance calculations show that sulfide phases host &gt;98 wt % of the Cu budget of bulk rocks (87−484 μg/g). The pyroxenites show significant variations of δ 65 Cu from −0.66‰ to 0.66‰, which cover the range known for peridotites, including metasomatized ones. Three subsamples from the same pyroxenite layer display &gt;0.3‰ decrease in δ 65 Cu with progressive differentiation. Nevertheless, δ 65 Cu does not display correlations with indicators of magmatic differentiation (e.g., Mg# and Cu/Pd) for all pyroxenites in this study. This might be attributed to variable extents of magmatic sulfide segregation for different samples and/or varying δ 65 Cu of the pyroxenite parent magmas, which were also affected by reactive migration through peridotites. The combined processes can change δ 65 Cu of evolving magmas and reacted peridotites and lead to Cu isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle, without involvement of oxidative metasomatism or recycled crustal materials.", "authors": ["Zongqi Zou", "Zaicong Wang", "Ming Li", "Harry Becker", "Xianlei Geng", "Zhaochu Hu", "Marina Lazarov"], "doi": "10.1029/2019jb017990", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1029/2019jb017990", "published": "2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "地幔岩浆迁移过程中的铜同位素变化：来自Balmuccia橄榄岩地块地幔辉石岩的见解", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "探讨岩浆分异过程是否会导致地幔岩石中铜同位素（δ65Cu）的显著变化。", "methodology": "分析意大利Balmuccia橄榄岩地块中新鲜地幔辉石岩的全岩铜同位素（δ65Cu），并进行质量平衡计算。", "key_findings": "辉石岩δ65Cu变化范围大（-0.66‰至0.66‰），且在分异过程中δ65Cu降低，表明岩浆过程可导致地幔铜同位素异质性。", "innovation": "首次证明正常岩浆分异和迁移过程本身即可导致地幔铜同位素的显著变化和异质性。", "relevance_note": "为理解地幔铜同位素异质性的成因提供了新的机制，挑战了传统上归因于地壳再循环或氧化交代作用的观点。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1029/2021gb007033", "title": "A Review on the Elemental and Isotopic Geochemistry of Gallium", "abstract": "Abstract Gallium exhibits weak metallic properties owing to its proximity to non‐metals in the periodic table, yet is volatile in extra‐terrestrial bodies and fairly reactive in nature.

Our results reveal that zircons from both rock associations are dominated by a rim‐ward increase in the 94 Zr/ 90 Zr ratio and accompanied by ∼1‰ intracrystalline and intercrystalline variations, confirming the preferential incorporation of light Zr isotopes and thus kinetic isotopic fractionation during zircon growth. Notably, zircons enclosed by K‐feldspar in monzodiorites generally yield lower 94 Zr/ 90 Zr and higher Zr/Hf ratios than that of separated crystals, while in K‐feldspar granites, tiny zircons intergrown with apatite obtain higher 94 Zr/ 90 Zr but lower Zr/Hf ratios relative to that of sizable separates.

Variations in chemical proxy of metasomatism, including high‐field strength elements (HFSE, e.g., Zr‐Ti isotopes and isovalent Zr‐Hf), have been commonly utilized as a tool to unravel the processes associated with the evolution of the Earth. However, the impact of mantle metasomatism by diverse agents on the Zr isotopic compositions of metasomatized mantle remains poorly understood. Here we carried out high‐precision double‐spike δ 94/90 Zr measurements for a suite of basalts, which were derived from the mantle sources metasomatized by typical metasomatic agents of fluid, silicate melt and carbonate melt originating from the deep mantle or recycled crustal materials. Mantle metasomatism results in lithological diversities within the mantle, ranging from hybridized peridotites to pyroxenite/eclogite and carbonated eclogite, which can significantly fractionate the isovalent HFSEs. However, our data show that these basalts have primitive mantle‐like δ 94 Zr NIST values (−0.033–0.043 ‰), regardless of their superchondritic Zr/Hf. The primitive mantle‐like δ 94 Zr NIST , irrelevant to any proxy of metasomatism (e.g., Sr‐Nd isotopes, Zr/Hf and La/Sm), indicate that mantle metasomatism and subsequence melting produce no measurable Zr isotopic variations in metasomatized mantle‐derived basalts. The δ 94 Zr NIST of basalts thus can be representative of the mean metasomatized mantle compositions.

To further evaluate the effect of desilicification, mass fractions of elements with variable chalcophile affinities (In, Cd, Cu, Ag, S, Se, Te, Re and PGEs) in different RMs were obtained by isotope dilution and digestion procedures involving HF‐HNO 3 in bombs versus HNO 3 ‐HCl in Carius tubes. The results show that the extraction efficiencies of HF‐desilicification vary in different RMs and for different elements.

Noticeably, desilicification led to a 10–30% increase in the mass fractions of Cu, Ag, S, Se and Te in BHVO‐2 and BIR‐1a, but less so in BCR‐2. These results could be attributed mainly to the variable chalcophile affinities of elements and their relative budget in sulfides, alloys and silicates. Desilicification should thus be preferred to determine chalcophile elements for most samples, except in cases where they are negligibly hosted in silicates.", "authors": ["Zongqi Zou", "Zaicong Wang", "Huai Cheng", "Tao He", "Yinuo Liu", "Kang Chen", "Zhaochu Hu", "Yongsheng Liu"], "doi": "10.1111/ggr.12328", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ggr.12328", "published": "2020-04-23T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "经HF脱硅和未经HF脱硅的地质标准物质中具有不同亲硫性元素的质量分数对比测定", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在评估脱硅处理对地质参考物质中不同亲硫性元素提取效率的影响。", "methodology": "采用同位素稀释法和两种不同消解方法（HF-HNO3炸弹消解与HNO3-HCl Carius管消解）测定元素质量分数。", "key_findings": "脱硅处理对不同参考物质和元素的提取效率各异，显著提高In和Cd，对Cu、Ag、S、Se、Te也有提升，但对强亲硫元素影响较小。", "innovation": "本研究首次系统评估了脱硅处理对地质参考物质中多种亲硫性元素（特别是较弱亲硫元素）提取效率的影响。", "relevance_note": "研究结果为地质样品中亲硫元素的准确测定提供了关键指导，建议多数情况下优先采用脱硅处理。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1111/ggr.12470", "title": "Quantification of Cl, Br and I in Geological Materials by <scp>NH<sub>4</sub>F</scp> Digestion: Comparison with Rapid Acid Digestion", "abstract": "The lack of analytical techniques for halogens in geological materials is mainly due to the loss of analytes during sample preparation.

Depending on magma types or conditions of phase equilibria, formation of these Ti‐rich minerals can result in Ti isotopic fractionation in the range of ‐1.52‰ to +2.90‰ on δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti (i.e., the per mil difference of 49 Ti/ 47 Ti ratio relative to the OL‐Ti reference material), making the Ti isotope ratios of these minerals potential tracers for conditions of magmatism and metamorphism. Due to their resistance to aqueous alteration, these Ti‐rich accessory minerals are also commonly present as pristine, detrital phases in sedimentary rocks, which offer an opportunity to study the evolution of magmatism and metamorphism throughout the Earth's geological history. Here we have developed a novel technique for in situ Ti isotopic measurement in ilmenite, titanite and perovskite using femtosecond laser ablation multi‐collector inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry (fs‐LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS) under wet plasma conditions. Samples were ablated with different laser spot sizes (15–50 μm) and different laser energy densities (0.6–4.2 J cm ‐2 ) to obtain adequate Ti signal intensity at a fixed laser repetition rate of 2 Hz. When 49 Ti signal intensity of samples ranged from 0.3 to 3.7 V, no significant signal‐dependent Ti isotopic fractionation was observed under wet plasma conditions. Repeated measurements on twelve Ti‐rich minerals using different analytical protocols provided comparable δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti values within uncertainties, confirming the accuracy of the proposed fs‐LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS method. With one exception (i.e., RUS1), all analysed minerals are homogeneous in their Ti isotopic compositions between individual chips with an intermediate precision of ±0.13‰ to ±0.17‰ (2 s ) on δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti .

Molybdenite–chalcopyrite mineralization of the deposit mainly occurs as veinlets in stockwork ore and dissemination in breccia ore, and two ore‐bearing quartz veins crop out to the south of the granite porphyry stock. Based on crosscutting relationships and mineral paragenesis, three hydrothermal stages are identified: (i) quartz–pyrite–molybdenite ± chalcopyrite stage; (ii) pyrite–quartz ± sphalerite stage; and (iii) quartz–calcite ± pyrite ± fluorite stage. Three types of fluid inclusions in the stockwork and breccia ore are recognized: LV, two‐phase aqueous inclusions (liquid‐rich); LVS, three‐phase liquid, vapor, and salt daughter crystal inclusions; and VL, two‐phase aqueous inclusions (gas‐rich). LV and LVS fluid inclusions are recognized in vein ore. Microthermometric investigation of the three types of fluid inclusions in hydrothermal quartz from the stockwork, breccia, and vein ores shows salinities from 1.57 to 66.75 wt% NaCl equivalents, with homogenization temperatures varying from 114°C to 550°C. The temperature changed from 282–550°C, 220–318°C to 114–243°C from the first stage to the third stage. The homogenization temperatures and salinity of the LV, LVS and VL inclusions are 114–442°C and 1.57–14.25 wt% NaCl equivalent, 301–550°C and 31.01–66.75 wt% NaCl equivalent, 286–420°C and 4.65–11.1 wt% NaCl equivalent, respectively. The VL inclusions coexist with the LV and LVS, which homogenize at the similar temperature. The above evidence shows that fluid‐boiling occurred in the ore‐forming stage. δ 34 S values of sulfide from three type ores change from −0.61‰ to 0.86‰.

A new paradigm, developed over the past decade, suggests that the GHS is not a single high‐grade lithotectonic unit, but consists of in‐sequence thrust sheets. In this study, we examine this concept in central Nepal by integrating temperature – time ( T–t ) paths, based on coupled Zr‐in‐titanite thermometry and U–Pb geochronology for upper GHS calcsilicates, with traditional thermobarometry, textural relationships and field mapping. Peak Zr‐in‐titanite temperatures are 760–850°C at 10–13 kbar, and U–Pb ages of titanite range from c . 30 to c . 15 Ma. Sector zoning of Zr and distribution of U–Pb ages within titanite suggest that diffusion rates of Zr and Pb are slower than experimentally determined rates, and these systems remain unaffected into the lower granulite facies. Two types of T–t paths occur across the Chame Shear Zone ( CSZ ). Between c. 25 and 17–16 Ma, hangingwall rocks cool at rates of 1–10°C/Ma, while footwall rocks heat at rates of 1–10°C/Ma. Over the same interval, temperatures increase structurally upwards through the hangingwall, but by 17–16 Ma temperatures converge. In contrast, temperatures decrease upwards in footwall rocks at all times. While the footwall is interpreted as an intact, structurally upright section, the thermometric inversion within the hangingwall suggests thrusting of hotter rocks over colder from c . 25 to c . 17–16 Ma. Retrograde hydration that is restricted to the hangingwall, and a lithological repetition of orthogneiss are consistent with thrust‐sense shear on the CSZ . The CSZ is structurally higher than previously identified intra‐ GHS thrusts in central Nepal, and thrusting duration was 3–6 Ma longer than proposed for other intra‐ GHS thrusts in this region. Cooling rates for both the hangingwall and footwall of the CSZ are comparable to or faster than rates for other intra‐ GHS thrust sheets in Nepal. The overlap in high‐ T titanite U–Pb ages and previously published muscovite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar cooling ages imply cooling rates for the hangingwall of ≥200°C/Ma after thrusting. Causes of rapid cooling include passive exhumation driven by a combination of duplexing in the Lesser Himalayan Sequence, and juxtaposition of cooler rocks on top of the GHS by the STDS .

We combine monazite chemistry with phase assemblages predicted by pseudosection modelling to link specific monazite growth domains to individual tectonic stages. Monazite domains containing moderate Th and low to moderate Y are interpreted to be preserved from the prograde path when garnet was stable, and constrain the timing of prograde metamorphism at 536 ± 4 Ma. High‐Th, low‐Y domains, dated at 527 ± 2 Ma, represent the earliest stages of post‐peak melt crystallization. Monazite domains with elevated Y and low‐moderate Th are interpreted to represent monazite growth during garnet breakdown at 514 ± 2 Ma. Our monazite ages, combined with published biotite Ar–Ar cooling ages, yield a two‐stage history of cooling at 3–8°C/Myr from ~530 Ma to ~510 Ma followed by cooling at 18–25°C/Myr from ~510 Ma to ~490 Ma, corresponding to 0.2–0.6 mm/yr of exhumation. This duration of granulite‐facies metamorphism in the Larsemann Hills is consistent with estimates for Precambrian granulite facies metamorphic complexes elsewhere.", "authors": ["Steven K.

Titanite may also incorporate significant inherited Pb, which may lead to inaccurate and geologically ambiguous U–Pb dates if a proper correction is not or cannot be applied. Here, we present laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA‐ICP‐MS)‐derived titanite U–Pb dates and trace element concentrations for two banded calcsilicate gneisses from south‐central Maine, USA (SSP18‐1A and SSP18‐1B). Single spot common Pb‐corrected dates range from 400 to 280 Ma with ±12–20 Ma propagated 2SE. Titanite grains in sample SSP18‐1B exhibit regular core‐to‐rim variations in texture, composition, and date. We identify four titanite populations: (1) 397 ± 5 Ma (95% CL) low Y + HREE cores and mottled grains, (2) 370 ± 7 Ma high Y + REE mantles and cores, (3) 342 ± 6 Ma cores with high Y + REE and no Eu anomaly, and (4) 295 ± 6 Ma LREE‐depleted rims. We interpret the increase in titanite Y + HREE between ca. 397 and ca. 370 Ma to constrain the timing of diopside fracturing and recrystallization and amphibole breakdown. Apparent Zr‐in‐titanite temperatures (803 ± 36°C at 0.5 ± 0.2 GPa) and increased X Di suggest a thermal maximum at ca. 370 Ma. Population 3 domains dated to ca. 342 Ma exhibit no Eu anomaly and are observed only in compositional bands dominated by diopside (&gt;80 vol%), suggesting limited equilibrium between titanite and plagioclase. Finally, low LREE and high U/Th in Population 4 titanite dates the formation of hydrous phases, such as allanite, during high X H2O fluid infiltration at ca. 295 Ma. In contrast to the well‐defined date–composition–texture relationships observed for titanite from SSP18‐1B, titanite grains from sample SSP18‐1A exhibit complex zoning patterns and little correlation between texture, composition, and date. We hypothesize that the incorporation of variable amounts of radiogenic Pb from dissolved titanite into recrystallized domains resulted in mixed dates spanning 380–330 Ma. Although titanite may reliably record multiple phases of metamorphism, these data highlight the importance of considering U–Pb data along with chemical and textural data to screen for inherited radiogenic Pb.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

The composition of chloritoid is extremely variable throughout the Massa Unit. Fe‐chloritoid occurs in association with hematite‐free, graphite‐bearing schists, whereas strongly zoned Fe‐Mg chloritoid is found with hematite and kyanite. We investigated the effect of different bulk Fe 2 O 3 contents in controlling chloritoid composition through phase equilibria modelling of four selected samples, representative of the different chloritoid‐bearing parageneses found in the Massa Unit. The ferric iron content, measured through wet chemical titration, ranges from 0 (graphite‐chloritoid schist) to 73% of the total iron (hematite‐chloritoid schist). We show that Mg‐rich chloritoid compositions and stability of kyanite at greenschist to blueschist facies conditions can be reproduced in the MnO–Na 2 O–K 2 O–FeO–MgO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 –H 2 O–TiO 2 –O (MnNKFMASHTO) chemical system only considering the presence of significant amounts of ferric iron as part of the bulk composition. The stabilization of kyanite at lower grade is directly linked to the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which renders the reactive bulk rock composition effectively enriched in Al 2 O 3 with respect to Fe and Mg. We also document that high Fe 2 O 3 contents exacerbate the effect of chloritoid fractionation, producing strongly zoned Fe‐Mg‐chloritoid grains. Finally, the P–T modelling of the Massa Units performed in this study allows, for the first time, the recognition of a two‐stage evolution at peak conditions, with an earlier pressure peak (1.2–1.3 GPa at 350–400°C), and a later thermal peak (0.7–1.1 GPa at 440–480°C), compatible with subduction, underthrusting and exhumation of the Adria continental margin during growth of the Northern Apennine orogenic wedge.", "authors": ["Samuele Papeschi", "Federico Rossetti", "Jesse B.

Most U–Pb zircon geochronological and metamorphic studies have focused on rocks from the central region of the mainland LGC, where granulite facies assemblages associated with the oldest (Badcallian) tectono‐metamorphic event at c. 2.75 Ga are overprinted by younger amphibolite facies assemblages related to the Inverian (c. 2.5 Ga) and subsequent Laxfordian (c. 1.9–1.65 Ga) tectono‐thermal events. In the southern and northern regions of the mainland LGC, deformation and metamorphism associated with the Laxfordian event are pervasive, although the timing and conditions are poorly constrained. Here, we present new field, petrographic and structural data, U–Pb zircon and titanite geochronology and phase equilibrium modelling of amphibolite samples from the northern and southern regions. Our field observations show that in both regions, pre‐Laxfordian structures are significantly reworked by steep NW‐striking fabrics that are themselves pervasively overprinted by co‐axial deformation and amphibolite facies metamorphism related to the Laxfordian event. In situ U–Pb titanite geochronology yields Laxfordian ages of 1853 ± 20 Ma in the southern region (P = 6–8 kbar and T = 640–690°C) and 1750 ± 20 Ma and 1776 ± 10 Ma in the northern region (P = 6–7.5 kbar and T = 740–760°C). While U–Pb dating of zircon rims from felsic gneisses in the central region shows a dominant Inverian metamorphic overprint at c. 2500 Ma, zircon rims in felsic gneisses from the northern and southern regions commonly yield Laxfordian dates as young as c. 1800 Ma. Combined, the results support the idea that, during the Palaeoproterozoic, the central region of the LGC acted as low‐strain domain, in which intense deformation and metamorphism were restricted to crustal‐scale shear zones. By contrast, in the southern and northern regions, early (c. 1.85 Ga) and late (c. 1.75 Ga) Laxfordian deformation and fluid‐mediated metamorphism were much more pervasive and at higher P–T conditions than previously proposed. The diachronous Laxfordian evolution of the southern and northern regions indicate that they reflect early and late snapshots of collisional to transpressional tectonics in the mainland LGC. The long‐lasting Laxfordian evolution documents the collision of the Rae and North Atlantic cratons during the Palaeoproterozoic amalgamation of the supercontinent Nuna, with implications for the palaeogeographic configuration of NW Scotland during Palaeoproterozoic Nuna.", "authors": ["Silvia Volante", "Annika Dziggel", "Jesse B.

Besides being one of the classical minerals datable using the U–Pb system, rutile incorporates a broad range of trace elements, many of those being incompatible in most of the common metamorphic minerals. Although numerous multivariate statistical or machine‐learning tools are available, current rutile discrimination schemes suffer from focusing on uni‐ and bivariate approaches leading to large compositional overlaps. Here we compiled and enlarged a dataset of 2335 rutile trace‐element analyses (1646 new analyses) from 110 metamorphic rock samples of 48 localities covering a wide range of pressure–temperature conditions. After showing that the subsampling and testing strategy of the classical random forest algorithm is inappropriate for such hierarchical data structures, we introduce a modified version (random forests for hierarchically structured data) which provides realistic and generalized error estimates, improving hyperparameter tuning and performance. By applying this concept, we present a novel and multivariate rutile discrimination scheme, using the concentrations of 16 elements. The model correctly predicts the source rock composition (felsic versus mafic) in ~89% of the cases and the metamorphic gradient (≤ 350 °C/GPa versus &gt; 350 °C/GPa) in ~84%. Combined with U–Pb dating, this will enable time‐resolved insights into the geodynamic evolution of the hinterland, taking rutile provenance analysis to the next level. This approach furthermore highlights specific elements and ratios — previously understudied — that reflect bulk‐rock and partitioning effects, making them valuable for future investigation of metamorphic processes.

A magmatic-hydrothermal origin or mantle-derived fluid source has been proposed for the giant gold deposits of the Jiaodong District in the eastern North China craton, but direct evidence is sparse, and the mineralization processes remain controversial. Here, we present the results of a comprehensive geological, geochronological, and geochemical study of the gold mineralized Xiejia diorite beneath the Linglong ore field at Jiaodong to link the gold mineralization to underlying magmatism. Magmatic zircon and titanite grains from the Xiejia diorite have laser ablation−inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb ages of 121.3 ± 0.9 Ma to 120.8 ± 1.1 Ma and 121.7 ± 3.9 Ma, respectively, which are indistinguishable from the time of gold deposition throughout the Jiaodong District as constrained by previous studies. The diorite has a shoshonitic composition and is characterized by strong enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) along with significant depletion in high field strength elements (HFSEs) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs). Samples of the diorite have high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, but low εNd(t) and ɛHf(t) values and low Pb isotope ratios. These geochemical characteristics are akin to those of contemporaneous mafic dikes in most gold mines at Jiaodong, indicating that the Xiejia diorite was most likely derived from an enriched lithospheric mantle source. The upper part of the diorite intrusion is pervasively altered and mineralized, containing an average of 0.32 g/t Au, but locally up to 7.59 g/t. Hydrothermal titanite from the mineralized diorite has a LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age of 122.3 ± 4.3 Ma, which is consistent with the gold-bearing pyrite Re-Os isochron age of 122.5 ± 6.7 Ma. Ore-related sericite aggregates from the Dongfeng gold deposit above the Xiejia diorite have a 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 122.6 ± 1.3 Ma. Pyrite from the mineralized diorite yielded δ34SCDT values of 2.1‰−9.7‰, which are comparable with those of pyrite (δ34SCDT = 5.8‰−8.1‰, where CDT indicates the Canyon Diablo troilite standard) from gold ores of Dongfeng. Pyrite grains from both groups also have similar Pb isotope compositions. The S and Pb isotope data are consistent with values of mafic dikes that are spatially and temporally associated with gold veins in the Linglong ore field. The results presented here thus indicate a possible genetic link between gold mineralization in the Xiejia diorite and underlying magma presumably represented by the Xiejia diorite. The auriferous fluids exsolved from that magma and migrated upward along the Potouqing fault to form the Dongfeng gold deposit above the Xiejia diorite. The mineralized diorite thus links shallow gold mineralization to deep-seated mantle-derived magmatism generated during the extensive destruction of the North China craton induced by the rollback of the subducted paleo-Pacific plate.", "authors": ["Zhan-Ke Li", "Jianwei Li", "Huashan Sun", "Xin-Fu Zhao", "Andrew G.

Here, we integrated petrological and geochemical analyses on this soil and its main components to estimate the compositions of local mare basalt and nonmare components. The landing site basalt is a typical low-Ti basalt with low Mg# (30–31) and low contents of Th (1 ppm) and other incompatible elements. The bulk soil overall shows homogeneous major and trace elemental compositions, which are very different from the local basalt. Combined with petrological constraints, such differences reveal an incorporation of ~40 ± 5 wt% of noritic crust ejecta and 2–3 wt% meteoritic materials, without mantle-rock fragments. The mean composition of nonmare materials corresponds to anorthositic norite or norite (~60 ± 5 vol% plagioclase) and is broadly comparable with Northwest Africa (NWA) 2995 clan meteorites and the prediction from remote sensing data for the SPA basin. The low-Th contents of the basalt, soil, breccia, and impact glasses (1–2 ppm) support negligible Th-rich components in ejecta materials and the underlying mantle and crust.

Incipient melts from mantle peridotite melting are highly mobile and tend to quickly escape from their sources; however, it remains enigmatic how the LVZ can extend to the depths where partial melting initiates. Here, we identify a suite of primitive low-MgO basalts derived from an eclogitized oceanic crust at ~200 km within the LVZ, providing a compelling scenario for the LVZ formation. These primitive basalts exhibit significantly heavier Fe isotopes and lighter Ca-Mo-O isotopes compared to mid-ocean-ridge basalts, indicating that they originated from eclogitized oceanic crust rather than peridotite. This highlights the fact that oceanic crust recycled into the mantle can melt to form primitive Mg-poor and Si-rich melts. Given their relatively high density and viscosity, these melts show low-mobility and accumulate at depths of ~150–200 km, forming a low-velocity layer within the asthenosphere.", "authors": ["Zongqi Zou", "Yi‐Gang Xu", "Zaicong Wang", "Yu Wang", "Ming Li", "Meiling Wang", "Yong Lei"], "doi": "10.1130/g53540.1", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1130/g53540.1", "published": "2025-09-05T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Geology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "榴辉岩质洋壳的熔融：地球上地幔软流圈内低速带的成因", "domain": "岩石学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在解释地球上地幔低速带（LVZ）如何延伸至部分熔融起始深度。", "methodology": "通过识别并分析来自LVZ的原始低镁玄武岩的Fe、Ca、Mo、O同位素组成。", "key_findings": "发现LVZ中的原始玄武岩源自榴辉岩化的洋壳熔融，其高密度和高粘度使其在深部积累形成低速层。", "innovation": "首次提出榴辉岩化洋壳熔融是LVZ形成和维持的关键机制，解决了地幔橄榄岩熔体移动性高的难题。", "relevance_note": "为理解地球上地幔低速带（LVZ）的形成机制及其对地球动力学的影响提供了新视角。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1130/geol.s.28790627", "title": "Supplemental Material: Chemical compositions of Chang’e-6 lunar soil and substantial addition of noritic crust ejecta from Apollo basin", "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Detailed description of samples, analytical methods, bulk and in-situ data, and recommended values for non-mare components of CE-6 soil, as well as supplementary figures. &lt;/p&gt;", "authors": ["Zaicong Wang", "Y.

The excess of HSE and the chondritic ratios of most HSE in primitive mantle (PM) have been interpreted to reflect the accretion of a chondritic ‘late veneer’ of about 0.5 % of Earth’s mass after core formation. The moderately volatile chalcogens S, Se and Te are moderately to highly siderophile at high pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions, thus, if depleted by core formation, their mantle abundances would reflect the volatile composition of the late veneer. Mantle peridotites with different extent of depletion by partial melting and re-enrichment by melt infiltration have been analyzed for abundances of S, Se and Te, in comparison to HSE, to constrain their abundances and ratios in the PM. Comparative studies of the Baldissero and Balmuccia peridotite bodies (Ivrea-Verbano Zone, Italian Alps) and of mantle pyroxenites from Balmuccia indicate details of the influence of partial melting and melt infiltration on abundances of HSE, S, Se and Te and 187Os/188Os in the mantle and fractionation of these elements during melt transport and redistribution in the mantle. At Balmuccia, Re depletion ages (TRD) of lherzolites and replacive dunites display a uniform distribution with a peak at 300-500 Ma. Baldissero peridotites also display a Paleozoic distribution peak but a significant number of samples yielded Proterozoic TRD. The different extents of preservation of ancient 187Os/188Os in Balmuccia and Baldissero peridotites reflect different degrees of isotopic homogenization and chemical re-equilibration with infiltrating incompatible element-depleted melt during the Paleozoic. The differences between the two bodies are also reflected by homogeneity of HSE and chalcogen abundances at Balmuccia. The lithophile element, HSE and chalcogen variations of different suites of lherzolites likely reflect different extents of reactive melt infiltration in mantle peridotites with partial re-equilibration and melt extraction in open system environments. The compositions and contact relations of the replacive Balmuccia dunites with the host lherzolites indicate that focused flow of sulfur-undersaturated melt occurred after the melting episode in the lherzolites. The compositional record of the Balmuccia massif thus reflects the composition of different types of melts and their interaction with the peridotites at different P-T conditions. Magmatic fractionation of chalcogens, the HSE and Os isotopes in websterites and spinel clinopyroxenites in the Balmuccia peridotite massif sheds significant insight on the connection between the reactive infiltration of mantle peridotites and pyroxenite formation and on the role of pyroxenites during melting of heterogeneous mantle. Both websterites and clinopyroxenites are consistent with crystal accumulation from S saturated melts but have different contents and fractionations of the HSE and chalcogens. Notably, in websterite parent melts, Re/Os, Pd/Ir, S/Re, S/Se, Se/Te, high HSE contents and initial Os isotopes are similar to values for secondary interstitial sulfides of refertilized peridotites reported in the literature, but different from unequilibrated sulfide inclusions in peridotite minerals. These observations suggest a common origin of sulfides precipitated from silicate melts during refertilization of peridotites and melts that have precipitated websterites. The similarities imply that open system melting of peridotites occurred by preferential removal of interstitial sulfides with silicate melts during melt extraction and melt- peridotite reaction. Clinopyroxenites have MORB-like HSE and chalcogen compositions and high S, Se and Re contents similar to websterites, but display lower abundances and stronger fractionations of other HSE and Te compared to websterites. Subparallel HSE patterns with several orders of magnitude variation and S/Se and Se/Te ratios suggest that clinopyroxenites formed from evolved melts that have undergone sulfide segregation in the mantle. Incomplete equilibration of infiltrating melts with peridotites and selective remelting of pyroxenites or veined peridotites can explain Os isotopic disequilibrium and heterogeneity in the mantle and in basalts. Results for mantle peridotites and pyroxenites are consistent with sulfide- silicate melt partitioning and mixing during reactive infiltration as the dominant control on abundances of the HSE, S, Se and Te in magmas and mantle rocks. Apparent partition coefficients during low to moderate degrees of melt extraction and subsequent fractional crystallization are: DPt &gt; DPd &gt; DTe &gt; DAu (?) &gt; DSe ≥ DS ≈ DRe. Variable degrees of refertilization of lherzolites apparently does not produce significant differences in HSE and chalcogen ratios such as Os/Ir, Ru/Ir, Rh/Ir, Pd/Pt, S/Se and Se/Te. A linear decrease of S abundances with decreasing Al2O3 contents, both for the whole data set of mantle peridotites, and for individual suites of peridotites, reflects sulfide removal controlled by sulfur solubility in silicate melt, or co-precipitation with pyroxenes and spinel. Similarly, Se and Te also display positive trends with Al2O3 and S contents, although with larger scatter. S/Se and Se/Te in the lherzolites change little with decreasing Al2O3, with a mean S/Se of 2690±700 (1σ, n=53) and Se/Te of 7.9±1.6 (1σ, n=63). Regression of abundances of S, Se, Te, Pd and Al2O3 contents in the peridotites yield minimum estimates on abundances of S, Se and Te in the PM (S=211±40 µg/g, Se=80±17 ng/g, Te =11.0±1.7 ng/g, 1σ; or 0.0040±0.0008×CI chondrites). The mean S/Se and Se/Te of mantle lherzolites overlap with CI chondrite values, and Se/Te in these samples are significantly different from ordinary and enstatite chondrites. The chalcogen/HSE ratio of the PM is similar to CM group carbonaceous chondrites, consistent with the view that the HSE signature of the PM reflects a predominance of slightly volatile depleted carbonaceous chondrite like material, possibly with a minor proportion of non-chondritic material. The chondritic composition indicates that the proportion of chalcogens in the mantle that are leftover from core formation must be negligible. A volatile- rich late veneer after formation of Earth’s core may have provided from 20 % to 100 % of the budget of water and carbon in the silicate Earth. Geological reference materials with variable composition and NIST SRM 612 have been analyzed to evaluate the utility of the analytical methods newly developed in this work. The results show that the method may minimize loss of volatile chalcogens during the closed-system digestion of a high pressure asher and indicates different extent of heterogeneity of chalcogens and HSE at low test portion size and importance of obtaining HSE and chalcogen contents in the same sample aliquot.", "authors": ["Zaicong Wang"], "doi": "10.17169/refubium-10257", "url": "https://doi.org/10.17169/refubium-10257", "published": "2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Refubium (Universitätsbibliothek der Freien Universität Berlin)", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "地球地幔岩石中硫族元素和高亲铁元素丰度对地幔过程和晚期增生的制约", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在利用硫族元素和高亲铁元素丰度及Os同位素，约束地球晚期增生历史和地幔过程。", "methodology": "研究分析了Ivrea-Verbano带的地幔橄榄岩和辉石岩中的硫族元素、HSE丰度及Os同位素，并评估了新开发的分析方法。", "key_findings": "原始地幔的硫族元素/HSE比值与CM球粒陨石相似，表明晚期增生主要为贫挥发性碳质球粒陨石物质，且核幔分异后地幔中硫族元素残留量可忽略。", "innovation": "本研究开发并评估了新的硫族元素分析方法，可最大程度减少高压灰化密闭消化过程中挥发性硫族元素的损失。", "relevance_note": "这项研究深化了对地球晚期增生、地幔过程和挥发性元素来源的理解，对行星演化模型至关重要。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.17632/6h4r5ddvw4.1", "title": "Data for: Calcium isotopic compositions of oceanic crust at various spreading rates", "abstract": "The data files include major and trace elements and Ca isotope compositions of the SWIR gabbroic rocks and the EPR and SMAR basalts and modelling Ca isotope variation during magmatic differentiation at various pressures.", "authors": ["Zaicong Wang"], "doi": "10.17632/6h4r5ddvw4.1", "url": "https://doi.org/10.17632/6h4r5ddvw4.1", "published": "2021-02-11T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": null, "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "不同扩张速率下洋壳钙同位素组成数据", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在研究不同扩张速率下洋壳的钙同位素组成及其在岩浆分异过程中的变化规律。", "methodology": "采用了测量西南印度洋脊辉长岩、东太平洋海隆和南大西洋中脊玄武岩的元素及钙同位素组成，并对岩浆分异过程中的钙同位素变化进行建模。", "key_findings": "提供了西南印度洋脊辉长岩、东太平洋海隆和南大西洋中脊玄武岩的元素和钙同位素数据，并建立了岩浆分异过程中钙同位素变化的模型。", "innovation": "创新性地结合了不同扩张速率洋壳岩石的钙同位素数据，并对岩浆分异过程中的钙同位素变化进行了建模。", "relevance_note": "为理解洋壳形成和岩浆分异过程中的钙同位素地球化学行为提供了关键数据和理论模型。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.21203/rs.3.rs-8052631/v1", "title": "Supracrustal origin of Earth’s earliest continents", "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> The genesis of Archean continental crust through partial melting of hydrous mafic protolith is widely acknowledged, yet the origin of the mafic protolith remains highly contentious.

Despite the ubiquity of carbonates in the slab, little is known of the physicochemical behavior of siderite and rhodochrosite at high-pressure (P) and high-temperature (T) conditions during slab subduction. In this study, we characterized the Raman vibrational spectra of natural siderite and rhodochrosite up to 47 GPa and 1100 K in an externally heated diamond-anvil cell (DAC). Experimental results show that the Raman frequency shifts (νi) for siderite and rhodochrosite are a function of both P and T, and the effect of the P-T cross derivative term cannot be neglected, especially at high-P and high-T conditions. Based on the functional relationship of νi-P-T, the P-T calibrants of siderite and rhodochrosite are developed, respectively. This is significant for studying the water-carbonate interaction at high P-T conditions in a DAC because the undesired change of the experimental system from traditional pressure sensors (e.g., ruby, quartz) in a reaction chamber can be avoided. Like previous studies, we observed a sharp spin transition at ~45 GPa in siderite and a phase transition from MnCO3-I to MnCO3-II at ~46 GPa for rhodochrosite at room temperature. Furthermore, we determined the isobaric and isothermal equivalents of the mode Grüneisen parameter (γiT, γiP) and the anharmonic parameter (ai) for each Raman mode of siderite and rhodochrosite.

绿松石（CuAl6（PO4）4（OH）8·4（H2O））是重要的表生宝石矿物，已有研究采用绿松石主量元素Cu的同位素进行产地溯源，但是溯源机理不明确.此外，绿松石生长过程复杂，该过程是否造成Cu同位素组成的显著变化还不甚清楚，这限制了其产地溯源的应用.湖北省竹山县是全球最大的宝石级绿松石产出地，采用MC-ICP-MS对竹山县条带状绿松石的生长条带进行高精度Cu同位素测试.结果表明：绿松石δ65Cu值较高，然而不同条带没有明显变化（δ65Cu=10.99‰~11.54‰）.绿松石含矿热液沉淀过程分馏有限（< 1‰），这指示绿松石Cu同位素显著变化主要发生在含矿热液的形成过程.原生硫化物的δ65Cu=0±1‰，显著低于绿松石样品测定值，推测引起含矿热液Cu同位素显著分馏的主要原因是原生硫化物发生氧化作用.全球典型绿松石矿区的数据整体与该结果一致，表明绿松石Cu同位素组成主要受源区环境的控制；同一矿区中形成的绿松石，即使经历周期生长产生条带状结构，其Cu同位素组成基本一致.该研究深入探究了Cu同位素示踪绿松石矿区的机理，同时也加深了对低温过程Cu同位素分馏的认识.

Ma早白垩世期间经历强烈改造,并伴随大规模岩浆活动.对比研究了这一时期山东鲁西地区、郯庐断裂带和胶东半岛玄武安山岩-安山岩等幔源岩石的地球化学特征和Sr-Nd同位素组成,探讨了各地区火山岩源区性质以及造成源区不均一性的可能原因. 这些火山岩均来自富集型地幔且受地壳组分的混染影响较小,并主要经历了单斜辉石、磷灰石和Ti-Fe氧化物的分离结晶,但相较于郯庐断裂带和胶东半岛而言,鲁西火山岩的演化程度更低. 不同地区火山岩均具有岛弧型微量元素和富集的Sr-Nd同位素组成,其中,鲁西北部火山岩表现为(87Sr/86Sr)i < 0.706的Ⅰ型富集地幔特征,而鲁西南部、郯庐断裂带以及胶东地区火山岩则具有(87Sr/86Sr)i > 0.706的Ⅱ型富集地幔特征,这暗示上述火山岩可能均来自被再循环地壳物质改造的富集地幔源区,且其源区富集程度具有从西北到东南逐渐增强的趋势. Sr-Nd同位素两端元混合模拟显示,鲁西北部火山岩EMⅠ型同位素特征可能与其地幔源区受华北下地壳物质的交代有关,而鲁西中-南部、郯庐断裂带和胶东地区火山岩EMⅡ型同位素特点则更可能是源区受三叠纪俯冲扬子陆壳组分改造的结果. 古太平洋板块来源的俯冲流体交代和水化也对这些地区的富集岩石圈地幔有不同程度改造. 因此,山东半岛不同地区早白垩世火山岩记录了不同性质壳源组分对华北克拉通东部岩石圈地幔的影响,这一差异性改造对华北东部岩石圈地幔的破坏和减薄有重要制约作用. 关键词: 早白垩世 / 中基性火山岩 / 富集岩石圈地幔 / 地幔交代 / 华北克拉通 / 地球化学", "authors": ["Lang Wang", "Huayun Tang", "Xiang Wang", "Keqing Zong",

Chang’e-6 (CE-6) mission provide a unique opportunity to study the composition and formation of the lunar crust on the farside of the Moon. This study examines the petrogenesis of anorthosites and noritic anorthosites from the lunar farside using samples collected by the CE-6 mission. The analysis reveals that the ferroan anorthosite (FAN) clasts display plagioclase An# and mafic mineral Mg# within the range of Apollo FANs, highlighting the compositional similarity between the lunar nearside and farside. The identification of FANs on the farside underscores the global nature of these lithologies, indicating that the early lunar crust formation processes were not confined to the nearside but were widespread across the Moon. The noritic anorthosite clast shows characteristics consistent with KREEP-free/poor Mg-suite rocks. This finding supports the idea that both the nearside and farside experienced similar magmatic processes, challenging the simplistic hemispheric dichotomy models. The study emphasizes significant lithological variations at local scale and the need for further sample-return missions to elucidate the compositional diversity and formation history of the lunar crust.", "authors": ["Jia-Qi Zheng", "Qi He", "Zaicong Wang", "Jun Huang", "J.

Sulu orogenic belt is world-known as an ultra-high pressure (UHP) terrane formed by continental subduction and collision.Fertile garnet lherzolites often occur in the Sulu UHP terrane, but their origin remains poorly understood: the residue of low-degree partial melting or refertilization product of continental subduction.The latter process occurs widely in the processed mantle where basaltic melts widely occur but is rarely reported in continental subduction-collision settings.Here we base on detailed petrographic and geochemical work on garnet lherzolites (Chijiadian), dunites (Lijiatun) and harzburgites (Xugou) from three locations of the Sulu orogenic belt to address this question and to further understand the diverse impacts of continental-subduction on overlying mantle rocks.Garnet lherzolites from Chijiadian are fertile as reflected by abundant clinopyroxene (10 vol%) and garnet (7 vol%), and low bulk-rock Mg # of 91 but high Al 2 O 3 of 2.39 to 3.31wt.%.Garnet, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene include early-stage phases such as olivine and spinel, mainly occur in grain boundary and display secondary poikilitic textures.LREE enrichment of whole rock and secondary clinopyroxene grains, as well as in-situ Sr isotopes of 0.7062-0.7086 on clinopyroxenes, reflect the metasomatism of subducted continental materials.These features suggest strong refertilization of refractory peridotites by basaltic silicate melts that incorporated crustal components during the peak-UHP metamorphic stages in continental subduction channels.Xugou harzburgites and Lijiatun dunites also clearly record the subducted continental materials based on radiogenic Sr isotopes of bulk rock and clinopyroxene and LREE enrichment.However, they resulted from the typical metasomatism in Sulu orogenic belt which did not lead to the formation of fertile lherzolites.Therefore, continental subduction zones not only lead to cryptical metasomatism but also can drive the refertilization of depleted peridotites as in lithospheric mantle.", "authors": ["Aiqing Ren", "Zaicong Wang", "Keqing Zong", "Wen Zhang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Zhaochu Hu"], "doi":

"Abstract. Garnet is commonly used to calculate pressure (P)-temperature (T) histories of metamorphic rocks, as well as to monitor changes in bulk-rock composition (X) and deformation (d). In situ U-Pb geochronology by laser ablation-inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is a rapid and relatively high spatial resolution technique, which can be used to constrain the timing of the metamorphic P–T–X–d histories preserved in garnet. However, the low U contents (low µg/g to ng/g levels) of most common metamorphic garnet crystals presents unique analytical challenges, including potential contamination of the U-Pb system by high-U inclusions, such as zircon, rutile, and monazite. Here we use LA split-stream (SS)-ICPMS analysis to simultaneously measure the U, Th, and Pb isotopes and trace-element contents of eclogite-facies garnet from metamafic rocks at As Sifah, Oman. We observe abundant zircon micro-inclusions (&lt;2 µm) in all five dated samples. Strong linear correlations in U vs Zr contents in the analysed laser-ablation spots plot along garnet–zircon mixing lines, the slopes of which can only be explained by zircon contamination. Despite clear zircon contamination in the trace-element data, the time-resolved laser-ablation U and Pb signals show some irregularities but lack sharp diagnostic spikes typically indicative of inclusions. Instead, zircon micro-inclusions are sufficiently small, abundant, and dispersed over the scale of the laser spot site (193 μm diameter) such that their contribution to the U, Th, and Pb signals is diluted to produce irregular time-resolved signals that have previously not been identified as inclusions. Analyses affected by contamination result in well-defined U-Pb regression lines that give concordia intercept dates of 94–89 Ma. After screening, only one sample had sufficient inclusion-free analyses and spread in U-Pb ratios to calculate a statistically meaningful date. The calculated concordia intercept date of 71 ± 7 Ma is consistent within uncertainty of previously published garnet–whole rock Sm-Nd peak metamorphic ages. We suggest that the 94–89 Ma ages represent the growth of micro-zircons produced during low-grade metamorphism or hydrothermal alteration of the mafic tuff protolith during the submergence of and sediment deposition on the Arabian margin at this time. To obviate the effect of micro-inclusions in garnet LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronology, we recommend a careful examination of garnet grains by electron microscopy prior to analysis and determination of background garnet U, Th, Pb contents and Th/U combined with the rejection of analyses with even slight or moderately irregular signals. We also demonstrate that LASS-ICPMS is a powerful tool to screen for inclusion contamination for in situ U-Pb garnet geochronology, providing confidence in the geologic meaning of the resulting ages.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

The four investigated samples from blocks hosted in the serpentinite matrix m&amp;amp;#233;lange on Syros fall into three categories: unmetasomatized eclogite (Type I, n = 1), heavily metasomatized garnet-clinopyroxene bearing rocks (Type II, n = 2), and an eclogite which hosts veins of Andr + Acm + Ep + Hem + Chl (Type III, n = 1). Type I samples of metagabbroic eclogite are characterized by a peak assemblage of Grt + Cpx + Rt with abundant clinozoisite after lawsonite. In addition to Grt + Cpx, Type II samples contain Chl + Ilm + Py + Ap &amp;amp;#177; Ep &amp;amp;#177; Cam. Clinopyroxene compositions within Type I samples display a prograde trend of increasing jadeite and decreasing acmite. In contrast, the matrix clinopyroxene in one Type II sample exhibits compositions up to 60 % acmite component.

Here we summarize recent advances in quantifying this component of the deep sulfur cycle. First, primary metamorphic or inherited sulfides in oceanic-type eclogites are only rarely observed as inclusions and are typically absent from the rock matrix. Additionally, sulfides are relatively common in rocks metasomatized at the slab-mantle interface by slab-derived fluids during exhumation. Combined, these two observations suggest that sulfur loss from subducted mafic crust is relatively efficient. Thermodynamic modeling in Perple_X using the Holland and Powell (2011) database combined with the Deep Earth Water model suggests that the efficiency and speciation of sulfur loss varies depending on the degree of seafloor alteration prior to subduction and the geothermal gradient of the slab. In relatively cold subduction zones, such as Honshu, slab-fluids derived from subducted mafic crust are predicted to exhibit elevated concentrations of HSO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, SO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, HSO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, and CaSO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4(aq)&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, whereas hot subduction zones, such as Cascadia, are predicted to produce slab fluids enriched in HS&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; and H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;S at lower pressures. The oxidation of sulfur expelled from subducted pyrite is balanced by the reduction of Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, consistent with the low Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/SFe of exhumed eclogites relative to blueschists and altered oceanic crust. Where oxidized S-bearing fluids are produced, they are anticipated to interact with more reduced rocks at the slab-mantle interface and within the mantle wedge, resulting in sulfide precipitation and significant isotopic fractionation.

Here we use in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis of sulfur-in-apatite to monitor changes in the oxidation state of sulfur during high-P metasomatism by slab fluids in the subduction channel. Our samples include a 73 cm continuous transect of reaction zones between a metagabbroic eclogite block and serpentinite matrix from a m&amp;#233;lange zone on the island of Syros, Greece. The block core consists of garnet, omphacite, phengite, paragonite, epidote-clinozoisite, and rutile. In this region, apatite is only observed as elongate inclusions in omphacite cores. From the core outwards micas are increasingly replaced by epidote-clinozoisite, garnets are smaller and more frequent, pyrite + bornite is observed as inclusions in recrystallized omphacite, and apatite is increasingly abundant in the matrix and inclusions in garnet. A major transition at 48 cm separates an assemblage of Ca-Na amphibole, omphacite, chlorite, pyrite, and apatite from the inner garnet-bearing eclogite assemblages. Omphacite disappears from the assemblage at ~56 cm and amphibole compositions sharply transition to tremolite at 59 cm. Finally, the assemblage tremolite + talc + pyrite is observed after ~70 cm.Apatites in the eclogite assemblages exclusively display S6+ peaks in their absorption spectra. This includes apatite inclusions in omphacite in the least altered lithology, as well as matrix apatite and isolated apatite inclusions in garnet in the outermost metasomatized eclogite zone. In the intermediate pyrite-rich (~1&amp;#8211;5 vol %) amphibole + omphacite + chlorite zone, apatite displays a strong S1- absorption peak in most grains, with rare analyses showing mixed S1- and S6+. Finally, apatite in the outermost tremolite-bearing assemblages only displays a S6+ peak. The pyrite-rich zone at 48 cm occurs at the initial interface between the serpentinite matrix and eclogite block, characterized by a dramatic decrease in Na content and Mg#. Our data suggest that reduction of S6+ in infiltrating fluids to S1- in pyrite became focused as Fe diffused across the steep Mg# gradient, resulting in pyrite precipitation. In contrast, S reduction in the Mg-rich tremolite-dominant portions of the transect was limited by a lack of Fe, resulting in low modes of pyrite and fluid buffered S6+ in apatite. Finally, S6+-bearing apatite is also observed in reaction zone lithologies from elsewhere on Syros, suggesting our observations are not isolated.Two important conclusions are drawn from these data and observations: (1) In the case of Syros, slab fluids at eclogite-facies conditions carried oxidized S6+, and (2) The interaction of these fluids with eclogites composed of ferrous-Fe silicates resulted in extensive sulfide precipitation.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

Numerous high-pressure experiments have been conducted to determine SCSS, employing various regression methods to capture the thermodynamic characteristics of the system. However, existing empirical equations have shown limited predictive accuracy when applied to laboratory measurements. In this study, we have compiled and analyzed 542 experimental datasets encompassing diverse sulfide and silicate compositions under varying pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions (up to 24 GPa and 2673 K). Employing empirical equations, linear regression, Random Forest algorithms, and a novel hybrid approach combining empirical fits for P-T conditions with Random Forest modeling for compositions, we have developed multiple SCSS models. These models have been rigorously compared with laboratory measurements. Our findings reveal that the Random Forest and hybrid models exhibit exceptional predictive performance (R2 = 0.82&amp;#8211;0.91, mean average error [MAE] &lt; 746 ppmw S, residual mean standard error [RMSE] &lt; 972 ppmw S) in comparison to previous empirical models (R2 = 0.28&amp;#8211;0.69, MAE = 622&amp;#8211;1,170 ppmw S, RMSE = 1,070&amp;#8211;1,744 ppmw S). Linear regression falls in between the performance of classical and machine learning models. Furthermore, we have applied our hybrid model to predict SCSS during the solidification of magma oceans on Earth, Mars, and the Moon. A comparison of our model results with expected sulfur contents in residual magma oceans, calculated through mass balance, offers valuable insights. Our analysis confirms that sulfides precipitated during the early accretion phases of Earth and Mars, but not on the Moon. Subsequently, evolving compositions of magma oceans offset increasing sulfur concentrations, preventing sulfide precipitation during intermediate stages of crystallization.

While detrital zircon mostly derives from felsic igneous rocks and tourmaline is hardly datable, rutile is mainly sourced from metamorphic rocks and routinely datable by U&amp;#8722;Pb chronology. Thus, combining detrital rutile age information with trace-element based discrimination of different metamorphic source rocks has a high potential to gain time-resolved insights into the geodynamic evolution of the hinterland. However, trace-element based approaches are so far limited to (i) bivariate discrimination of mafic and felsic metamorphic source rocks by considering Cr and Nb concentrations (Zack et al. 2004a; Meinhold et al. 2008; Triebold et al. 2007, 2012), (ii) temperature information by considering Zr concentrations (e.g., Zack et al. 2004b; Kohn 2020) and assuming the same pressure conditions for all detrital grains, (iii) identification of fluid alteration based on e.g., W, Sn, V, Sb, Cr, Nb, Fe (Agangi et al. 2020; Pereira et al. 2021; Pereira &amp;amp; Storey 2023); and (iv) identifying very specific sources like mafic low-temperature/high-pressure rocks by considering H2O concentrations in combination with Zr, Nb, W, and Sn (Lueder et al. 2024).Here we compiled a dataset of 2,335 rutile trace-element analyses (16 elements) from 110 metamorphic rock samples of a wide range of pressure&amp;#8722;temperature conditions.

Garnet is commonly used to calculate pressure (P)–temperature (T) histories of metamorphic rocks, as well as to monitor changes in bulk-rock composition (X) and deformation (d). In situ U–Pb geochronology by laser ablation–inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is a rapid and relatively high spatial resolution technique, which can be used to constrain the timing of the metamorphic P–T–X–d histories preserved in garnet. However, the low U contents (low µg g−1 to ng g−1 levels) of most common metamorphic garnet crystals present unique analytical challenges, including potential contamination of the U–Pb system by high-U inclusions, such as zircon, rutile, monazite, and apatite. Here we use laser ablation split-stream (LASS) ICPMS (LASS-ICPMS) analysis to simultaneously measure the U, Th, and Pb isotopes and trace-element contents of eclogite-facies garnet from metamafic rocks at As Sifah, Oman. We observe abundant zircon micro-inclusions (&lt;2 µm) in all five dated samples. Strong linear correlations in U vs. Zr contents in the analysed laser ablation spots plot along garnet–zircon mixing lines, the slopes of which can only be explained by zircon contamination. Despite clear zircon contamination in the trace-element data, the time-resolved laser ablation U and Pb signals show some irregularities but lack sharp diagnostic spikes typically indicative of inclusions. Instead, zircon micro-inclusions are sufficiently small, abundant, and dispersed over the scale of the laser spot site (193 µm diameter) such that their contributions to the U, Th, and Pb signals are diluted to produce irregular time-resolved signals that have previously not been identified as inclusions. Analyses affected by contamination result in well-defined U–Pb regression lines that give concordia intercept dates of 94–89 Ma. After screening, only one sample had sufficient inclusion-free analyses and spread in U–Pb ratios to calculate a statistically meaningful garnet U–Pb date. The calculated concordia intercept date of 71±7 Ma is consistent within uncertainty of previously published garnet–whole-rock Sm–Nd peak metamorphic ages. We suggest that the 94–89 Ma ages represent the growth of micro-zircons produced during low-grade metamorphism or hydrothermal alteration of the mafic tuff protolith during the submergence of and sediment deposition on the Arabian margin at this time. To obviate the effect of micro-inclusions in garnet LA-ICPMS U–Pb geochronology, we recommend a careful examination of garnet grains by electron microscopy prior to analysis and determination of background garnet U, Th, and Pb contents and Th/U combined with the rejection of analyses with even slight or moderately irregular signals.

Subducting slabs are progressively depleted in volatiles and other mobile elements through dehydration and melting reactions. These elements are then introduced to the mantle wedge and volcanic arc. One consequence of this cycle is that volcanic arcs produce the most oxidized magmas on Earth. Sulfur, which exhibits a range in valence states from S2- to S6+, is one of the few elements in the subducting slab capable of oxidizing the arc and mantle wedge. Sulfides in the slab may also act as an important host of chalcophile and siderophile minor and trace elements (CSEs), such as Co, Ni, Cu, and As. The extraction of sulfur from the slab may also liberate and transfer these elements to the arc, where they may contribute to the formation of ore deposits. Such chemical and advective processes, which occur at depths in excess of 50 km, are not directly observable. Rocks and minerals in exhumed high-pressure terranes provide a chemical archive of sulfur and CSE extraction during subduction. In this dissertation, I examine the sulfur isotopic composition of sulfides in high-pressure and slab fluids, predict the concentration and speciation of sulfur in slab fluids, and characterize the CSE budget of the subducted mafic crust.\\nSulfur isotopes are a sensitive indicator of redox conditions and sulfur mobility. In situ sulfur isotope measurements were conducted using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on sulfides in high-pressure metamorphic rocks. Sulfides are classified into two categories: 1. Metamorphic sulfides, which preserve a record of prograde subduction metamorphism, and 2. Metasomatic sulfides precipitated from slab-derived fluids. The isotopic composition of metamorphic sulfides reflects their protolith compositions: −4.3 to +13.5 ‰ for metabasic rocks, and −32.4 to −11.0 ‰ for metasediments. From these data, I estimate that prograde sulfide breakdown will release slab fluids with an isotopic composition of −11 to +8 ‰. Metasomatic sulfides exhibit a range in δ34S values from −21.7 to +13.9 ‰, significantly larger than the range of predicted slab fluid compositions. The observed range of metasomatic sulfide compositions likely indicates large isotopic fractions between and oxidized slab fluid and the precipitating sulfide grains.\\nIn support of the sulfur isotope observations, I used equilibrium thermodynamic forward modeling software to predict the speciation and concentration of sulfur in slab fluids. Sulfur loss from the slab is sensitive to protolith Fe3+/SFe ratio and subduction zone thermal structure. Subduction of altered oceanic crust in cold subduction zones was found to produce significant fluxes of sulfate and sulfite species. In contrast, subduction along a warm subduction geothermal gradient produces a bi-modal release of sulfur-bearing fluids, with a low-volume shallow flux of reduced sulfur, followed by a high-volume deep flux of sulfate and sulfite species. Sulfur oxidation in these systems is balanced by ferric iron reduction. Matrix sulfides in high-pressure metamorphic rocks are rarely associated with peak metamorphic conditions, suggesting that sulfur is almost completely extracted from the slab across the blueschist to eclogite transition. The thermodynamic models predict that sulfur oxidation is balanced by iron reduction in the eclogitic slab residuum. This prediction is supported by the observation that oceanic eclogites display lower bulk rock Fe3+/SFe when compared to blueschist and altered oceanic crust.\\nPrograde sulfur-loss is anticipated to redistribute and/or release sulfide-hosted minor and trace CSEs. In situsulfide and silicate compositions were determined by laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for the elements Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, Tl, and Bi. Sulfides host nearly the entire Cu, As, Ag, Cd, and Te budget of subducted rocks. These elements are incompatible in garnet, omphacite, phengite, and rutile, and are almost completely lost from the slab during prograde sulfide breakdown. Cobalt, Ni, Zn, Ga, Ge, Mo, Sn, and Tl are hosted in silicate and oxide phases. While Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, and Pb may be partially lost during lawsonite, epidote, and amphibole dehydration reactions, Ge, Tl, Sn, and Mo are largely retained in garnet, phengite, and rutile. Mobilization of the latter elements may require high fO2 conditions or melting. Consistent with estimated CSE budgets, minor and trace element zoning in metasomatic sulfide and silicate minerals suggest that Co, Ni, and As are mobile in slab fluids. Sulfur lost from the slab is expected to oxidize the subarc mantle and arc magmas, whereas mobile CSE elements may contribute to the formation of arc-related ore deposits.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

This contrast complicates interpretations of mantle rheology. Here we report the temperature dependence of lattice preferred orientation in bridgmanite, the most abundant lower mantle mineral, through high-pressure deformation experiments at 25 gigapascals and 1700–2100 kelvin. Both iron-free and iron-bearing bridgmanite develop lattice preferred orientations across this temperature range, with distinct slip systems occurring below and above 1800 kelvin.

It has undergone multiple episodes of accretionary orogenesis and was tectonically reactivated during the Cenozoic by the far-field compressional effects of the India-Eurasia continental collision. These processes have generated pronounced seismicity and recurrent earthquake-related hazards in this region. A high-resolution three-dimensional velocity model is essential for multi-scale velocity model construction, source-parameter inversion, simulation of strong ground motion, and seismic hazard assessment. In this study, we collected first-arrival body-wave travel-time data recorded by permanent stations in and around Xinjiang and processed both ambient-noise and regional-earthquake surface-wave records. The resulting dataset comprises ∼8.1 million body-wave travel-time picks—including absolute arrival times and event-pair differential times—and ∼5,000 surface-wave dispersion curves (5–50 s period). By joint inversion of these complementary body and surface wave datasets, we determined a high-resolution three-dimensional Vp and Vs model for the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Xinjiang (XJVM-1.0) with a lateral resolution of 50–100 km and a vertical resolution of ∼10 km. XJVM-1.0 reveals that the Tianshan orogen exhibits a relatively rigid upper crust that hosts abundant seismicity under far-field compression, whereas its middle-lower crust accommodates the majority of compressional stress through plastic deformation and/or partial melting. In contrast, the interiors of the Junggar and Tarim basins have experienced negligible internal deformation and are inferred to underthrust beneath the Tianshan orogen in response to the India-Eurasia collision.

Here we integrate an earthquake catalogue, generated by machine-learning and template-matching techniques to enhance microseismicity detections, with geodetic data to show that seismic triggering of the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra Volcano, Galápagos Islands, was facilitated by a cryptic phase of fluid activity. Following 13 years of near-continuous magmatic inflation, totalling > 6.5 m, stress changes induced by a moment magnitude 5.4 intra-caldera earthquake on 26 June 2018 did not immediately trigger magma release from the pressurized magma reservoir. Instead, long-period earthquake swarms revealed post-seismic fluid activity along reservoir-bounding faults in the northwestern caldera, locally promoting edifice failure and facilitating magma intrusion that initiated 8 hours later.

Erosion of monazite-bearing slates and phyllites, and short-range transport resulted in localised recent alluvial deposits rich in millimetre-size monazite, of which the Matamulas site, within the Central Iberian Zone, represents one of the most extensive and potentially exploitable placer-type accumulations of Th-poor grey monazite in western Europe. Nodular monazite from the Matamulas area depicts spheroidal or triaxial ellipsoid shapes and is mostly greyish, although it may display different surface colours from yellow to black. The nodules contain abundant silicate (quartz, feldspar, white mica, chlorite, zircon) and Fe oxides-hydroxides, organic matter, rutile and Mn oxide inclusions, generally oriented at random or showing orientations related to original bedding anisotropy. Nodular monazite displays concentric optical zoning, continuous or oscillatory, associated with the abundance and nature of inclusions. Chemical zoning is typically progressive, with cores enriched in medium and heavy rare earth elements (REE), and rims rich in light REE (La-Ce). Substitution of Pr by La-Ce is decoupled from that of elements with smaller ionic radii. Thorium contents are low (estimated mean 0.16 wt % ThO2) and irregularly distributed across the monazite nodules. The increased concentration of phyllosilicate and other inclusions toward nodule rims, the sparse occurrence of twinning and the observed chemical zoning suggest progressive recrystallisation and refining from precursor gels or cryptocrystalline aggregates, facilitated by localized fluid-assisted element mobility during nodule growth. U-Pb dating of monazite yields an Early Devonian age of ca. 400&nbsp;Ma, significantly older than the Upper Carboniferous age of regional metamorphism and tectonic foliation in the host metasediments. The age obtained, together with their non-oriented growth within specific levels of the sedimentary pile, indicates that the process of formation of nodular monazite took place through diagenesis or burial metamorphism.

The Cretaceous Razab unit contains high-Cr# spinel chromitite (0.77–0.82), forearc, and island arc tholeiitic (IAT) lavas, supporting formation during subduction initiation.

Here, through pH manipulation experiments across diverse ecosystems and with a model ammonia-oxidizing archaea species, Nitrosopumilus maritimus strain SCM1, we discover a unifying adaptive mechanism: acidification triggers a compensatory increase in substrate affinity in ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. This enhancement counteracts the reduction in ammonia availability, with the magnitude of increase being significantly greater in ammonia-oxidizing archaea than in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Consequently, in ammonia-oxidizing archaea-dominated systems, this adaptation can sustain or even stimulate oxidation rates under moderate acidification, while ammonia-oxidizing bacteria-dominated systems experience a decline. By incorporating this affinity response into models, we accurately reconcile prior disparate field observations. We thus establish the regulation of substrate affinity as a key determinant of microbial resilience, providing a framework for predicting nitrogen cycle dynamics under future acidification.

In thermally immature crust, early eruptions are expected to be mafic, yet many volcanic provinces, particularly those with water-rich melts, lack significant initial mafic volcanism, suggesting an alternative trapping mechanism. We investigate this using Caraci volcano (Romania's Apuseni Mountains), a water-rich system that started with relatively differentiated, andesitic eruptions. The first eruptions at Caraci extruded water-rich (5–6 ± 0.35 wt% dissolved H 2 O) amphibole-plagioclase andesites (890–920 ± 22 °C) stored at water-saturated conditions in the upper-crust (~2 ± 0.5 kbar). These magmas were associated with superhydrous primitive melts (>6 wt% H₂O), which evolved in a polybaric system (crystallization pressure varying from 2 to 8 ± 0.5 kbar), evidenced by high-Mg amphibole and delayed plagioclase crystallization. These deeper storage melts likely reached water saturation during ascent towards the upper crust, inducing degassing and crystallization, which increased viscosity and enabled stalling in the cold crust, explaining the lack of initial mafic eruptions and providing the efficient trapping mechanism in a thermally immature crust. Progressive drying of the source and generation of less hydrous magmas initiated the eruptions and construction of the stratovolcano, and ultimately terminated the system. As a result, the final eruption extruded somewhat drier (4–4.5 ± 0.35 wt% H 2 O), hotter (930–960 ± 45 °C) pyroxene-bearing andesites erupted from water-undersaturated storage.

Northern Borneo (Sabah) with a complex geological history of multiple episodes of subduction, magmatism, uplift, subsidence, and extension since the Mesozoic, is an ideal location for studying post‐subduction processes. Major events in this region include subduction of the proto‐South China Sea beneath Sabah, terminating ∼21 Ma; postulated subduction of the Celebes Sea plate, terminating ∼9 Ma; extension in central Sabah ∼9–10 Ma; rapid emplacement and exhumation of a granite intrusion ∼7 Ma; and the development of a fold‐thrust belt offshore during the last 5 Myr. While these events have left imprints in the surface rock record, it has not been possible, until recently, to investigate deeper lithospheric processes. The installation of 46 broadband seismometers–the northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS)–between 2018 and 2020 means we can now constrain the architecture of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Sabah. We use two years of passive seismic data recorded by the nBOSS network, and 24 Malaysian Meteorological Service broadband seismometers to calculate P‐wave receiver functions.

The results show that the abundance and relative distribution of the naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene, and dibenzothiophene series vary significantly with increasing maturity.

This hierarchical interlayer architecture ensures uniform Li + distribution and redistributes internal stresses, mitigating localized stress concentrations and lattice expansion to preserve structural integrity throughout cycling.

Adsorptive separation via porous solids is considered one of the most promising alternatives to conventional energy-intensive cryogenic processes. While traditional adsorbents selectively capture xenon over krypton under ambient conditions, their desorption energy penalties for producing pure xenon impede practical implementation. Here, we present a metal‒organic framework characterized by synergistic structural and local flexibility that reverses conventional selectivity, thereby enabling preferential adsorption of krypton at room temperature. This material demonstrates a krypton uptake of 36.8 cm3 cm-3 (298 K, 1 bar) and achieves a Kr/Xe selectivity of 10.4 in 1/99 Kr/Xe mixture breakthrough experiments. Moreover, this material exhibits commendable radioactive stability and effectively captures trace amounts of krypton (40 ppm). Mechanistic studies indicate that dynamic adjustments in cavity windows and localized ligand vibrations work synergistically to exploit subtle size differences between krypton and xenon. This enables kinetically controlled sieving of krypton through transiently expanded channels. With an energy-efficient approach to krypton-centric separation, our research redefines the design paradigm for noble gas purification and offer new possibilities for separating other dynamically matched molecules through adaptive host‒guest interactions. Efficient Kr/Xe separation is crucial for high-tech industries, defense, and aerospace applications.

A single basaltic crater lava unit is more mafic (8 wt. % MgO, 51 – 52 wt. % SiO2) and is compositionally similar to rare low-magnesium basaltic tephra from large explosive eruptions, suggesting more primitive melts are present in the underlying crust but rarely erupt at the surface.

NWA 12241 is classified petrologically as low-shock based on its limited shock features. However, new Raman identification of tuite, a high-pressure phosphate polymorph, demonstrates that minimum temperatures of 1100 °C were achieved in some regions of the sample during ejection.

Thermal history modeling suggests that heterogeneous shock heating is required to explain the merrillite data distribution, with local shock temperatures of ≤570 °C necessary to account for preservation of the older dates. Together, the tuite occurrence and (U-Th)/He data support at least 530 °C (and up to 1730 °C) of variability in the peak shock temperature across this small (7.21 g, ∼4 cm) sample.

Its most recent caldera-forming eruption occurred ~1400 years ago, with numerous intra-caldera eruptions since. Erupted whole rock compositions are commonly attributed to fractional crystallisation along a single liquid line of descent, but mafic mineral clots indicate mafic recharge and magma mixing also influence whole rock compositions. Geophysical studies identified two low-velocity zones at ~0.5–4 km and 9–15 km beneath the caldera, suggesting a shallow reservoir for evolved magmas and a deeper mafic storage zone. However, uncertainties remain regarding depths, connectivity and temporal evolution of Rabaul’s magma storage zones. We present petrological and thermobarometric analyses of products from the 1937, 1994 and 2014 eruptions at Rabaul. Samples contain two distinct mineral clot types. Mafic mineral clots comprise olivine, high-anorthite plagioclase and high-Mg# clinopyroxene that are out of equilibrium with surrounding matrix glass. Textures include rapid growth rims, olivine replacement by orthopyroxene and reversely zoned clinopyroxene. We interpret these mafic mineral clots as cumulate fragments mobilised from a deep mafic mush by mafic recharge. Intermediate mineral clots contain low-anorthite plagioclase, low-Mg# clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and Ti-magnetite, and occur as macrocrysts in equilibrium with matrix glasses (Mg# 30–40). We interpret these intermediate mineral clots as fragments from a shallower, more evolved mush stored. Binary mixing models demonstrate that eruption products can be reproduced by mixing a mafic magma similar to 1937 basaltic enclaves with a dacitic magma resembling the last caldera-forming deposit. Clinopyroxene-only and clinopyroxene–liquid thermobarometry yield crystallisation pressures of 0.5–5 kbar (~2–20 km) and temperatures of 960–1125 °C, but the models lack the vertical resolution to resolve storage zones separated by ~5 km.

ScoE synthesizes an isonitrile functional group from a glycyl-fatty acid adduct, with both the isonitrile nitrogen and carbon atoms coming from the glycyl moiety. This challenging chemistry cannot be performed in a single step. Instead, the mechanism appears to require two half reactions, each involving αKG cleavage to generate a highly reactive iron-oxygen species. Here, we report sixteen crystal structures that provide snapshots along the reaction trajectory of Rv0097, a ScoE homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis . These structures, which are both of wild-type and Rv0097 variants, include a substrate 3-((carboxymethyl)amino)decanoic acid (CADA)-bound structure, an αKG-bound structure, and a structure with both CADA and αKG bound. These structural data reveal how Rv0097 employs conformational rearrangements to protect the unstable CADA-reaction intermediate that is formed in the first half reaction while swapping out αKG cleavage products for a second molecule of αKG. Additionally, these structures, together with data from site-directed mutagenesis, provide insight into Rv0097’s preference for substrates with long alkyl chains, potentially facilitating efforts to re-engineer ScoE/Rv0097 to synthesize isonitrile functional groups on a wider range of small molecules.", "authors": ["Naike Ye", "Antonio Del Rio Flores", "Wenjun Zhang", "Catherine L.

In the current conceptual framework, the initial stone nidus is thought to include the aggregation of inorganic crystallites, the formation of which is favored by elevated concentrations of dissolved constituents. Here, we show that this highly prevalent stone type comprises a form of organic–inorganic polycrystalline biocomposite with integrated bacterial biofilms. Evidence from electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy reveal the unanticipated internal structure of kidney stones from human patients, where bacterial biofilms are intercalated between polycrystalline mineral layers, even in stones identified as “noninfectious” clinically, including those in patients without underlying urinary tract infections. We observe similar bacterial biofilm architectures on the surfaces of stone fragments obtained due to lithotripsy, suggesting that bacteria are intrinsic to the process of nephrolithiasis. Crystallites proximal to biofilm layers exhibit significantly smaller grain sizes, which indicate a larger local concentration of nucleation sites. Staining reveals that biofilm areas of these stones are enriched with bacterial DNA. That bacteria are now observed so broadly in kidney stones (including even in less prevalent struvite stones) may be conceptually salient: Based on the evidence adduced here, we propose a model in which the urine-rich environment of the kidney can impinge on bacterial calcium homeostasis and amplify bacterial production of nucleation templates such as extracellular DNA.

The δ 98 / 95 Mo values show a sustained negative shift from ∼1‰ to −2‰ between ∼59.5 and 50.5 Ma, and this trend is best explained by strengthened Mo adsorption onto Mn and Fe bearing oxides at the sediment–water interface.

Prinzera, which hosts a hyperalkaline spring containing dissolved H 2 . A geochemical characterization of peridotite, pyroxenite, and serpentinite samples was carried out to reconstruct the past and present stages of serpentinization and to assess their H 2 generation potential. This study combined mineralogical, whole-rock compositional, and redox-state analyses, along with thermodynamic modeling of spring waters. The major serpentinization event associated with mantle exhumation in the Middle to Late Jurassic was marked by extensive replacement of olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene by serpentine and subordinate magnetite. Alteration was more intense in olivine than in pyroxenes, resulting in higher serpentinization degrees in peridotites (~ 50 vol%), compared to pyroxenites (~ 10 vol%). Mineralogical evidence suggests temperatures of approximately 220 °C and 300 °C for this stage. Currently, serpentinization and H 2 generation are likely active at Mt. Prinzera, with fluid-rock interactions involving particularly the oxidation of a small fraction of Fe 2+ -serpentine and/or magnetite, rather than the primary mineral assemblage. Thermodynamic equilibria, based on the activities obtained from the aqueous speciation, and the isotope composition of the hyperalkaline water were used to estimate the temperature at depth, which appears to be markedly low. In addition, trapped H₂ accumulations originating from earlier serpentinization stages can also be considered. Thus, serpentinization may occur either at the base of Mt.

The 2025 Sagaing earthquake generated an exceptionally long rupture (∼535 km), offering a rare opportunity to investigate rupture dynamics along continental transform fault. We integrate complementary high‐resolution imaging geodesy, teleseismic and strong‐motion waveforms, back‐projection, and finite‐fault inversion to investigate rupture extent, process, and slip evolution. Our results reveal a marked bilateral asymmetry in both rupture extent and speed: it propagated ∼85 km northward at sub‐shear speeds and ∼450 km southward predominantly at supershear speeds (∼6 km/s), punctuated by short sub‐shear segments. We propose that structural barrier and stress shadows limited the extent, whereas the SF's bimaterial interface and local stress‐drop heterogeneity jointly may potentially drive the asymmetric, intermittent supershear behavior.

The emergence of woven lattices—three-dimensional networks of entangled fibers—has introduced a pathway to the largely overlooked compliant and stretchable regime of metamaterials. However, the design and implementation of these complex architectures has remained a primarily manual process, restricting identification and validation of their full achievable design and property space. Here, we present a geometric design framework that encodes woven topology using a graph structure, enabling the creation of woven lattices with tunable architectures, functional gradients, and arbitrary heterogeneity. Through use of microscale in situ tension experiments and computational mechanics models, we reveal highly tunable anisotropic stiffness (varying by over an order of magnitude) and extreme stretchability (up to a stretch of four) within the design space produced by the framework. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of woven metamaterials to exhibit programmable failure patterns by leveraging tunability in the design process. This framework provides a design and modeling toolbox to access this previously unattainable high-compliance regime of mechanical metamaterials, enabling programmable large-deformation, nonlinear responses.

Here, we identified a strikingly conspicuous polarization signal used specifically during courtship in the cuttlefish Doratosepion andreanum and investigated the underlying optical mechanism. The signal consists of a pattern of adjacent horizontally and vertically polarized areas, optimizing signal detectability for cephalopod polarization vision. This pattern is generated by reflective cells called iridophores and transparent muscle: light becomes horizontally polarized when reflected by iridophores, and its angle of polarization is then rotated to vertical when transmitted through a birefringent muscle layer.

Here, inspired by natural metabolite sensing/signaling system, we develop a DNA origami-based ATP-sensing nanodevice (ND) for fine-tuning purinergic signaling and immune homeostasis. This ND composes a tubular DNA origami equipped with ATP sensors and the catalytic subunits (ENPP1-CD73 pairs), which can sense high levels of exATP and then expose the catalytic subunits for metabolizing exATP to adenosine, thereby driving an immune switch from exATP-mediated proinflammatory signals to adenosine-mediated immunosuppressive signals. Further surface displaying of ND on the monocytes (ND@Monos) enables its active inflamed site-targeting to restore immunometabolic hemostasis and reduce inflammation in diverse models in vivo. This study highlights that design of metabolite-sensing NDs is a promising strategy for controlling the homeostasis of cell metabolism and the immune response. Purinergic signalling dysregulation can drive inflammatory disorders, but effective targeted therapy is still lacking. Here, authors develop a smart DNA origami nanodevice that can precisely sense and metabolize high levels of extracellular ATP, thereby fine-tuning purinergic signalling and immune homeostasis.", "authors": ["Wei Li", "Shuyun Liu", "Xiyue Zhou", "Ke Lv", "Fei Liu", "Hong Chen", "Ruoqing Li", "Jun Xiao", "Yu Ma", "Hao Yang", "Chao Zhang", "Jingping Liu"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-68879-2", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68879-2", "published": "2026-01-26T05:15:04+00:00", "venue": "Nature Communications", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-27"}, "score": 0.44339609665358237, "similarity": 0.34037692100322675, "impact_factor_score": 0.8554727992550049, "impact_factor": 14.7, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "ignore", "translated_title": "一种基于DNA的纳米器件可感知嘌呤能信号并驱动免疫开关以促进炎症消退", "domain": null, "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "旨在解决嘌呤信号失调（如过量胞外ATP）引发的炎症及现有受体阻滞药物效果不佳的问题。", "methodology": "开发了一种搭载ATP传感器和酶对的管状DNA折纸纳米装置，并将其修饰在单核细胞表面进行靶向递送。", "key_findings": "该装置能感应高水平胞外ATP并转化为腺苷，驱动免疫反应从促炎转向抑炎，有效恢复体内免疫代谢稳态。", "innovation": "创新设计了模拟天然代谢感应的智能DNA纳米装置，实现了从ATP促炎到腺苷抑炎信号的主动转化与调控。", "relevance_note": "本研究证明了代谢感应纳米装置在调控细胞代谢和免疫反应稳态方面的潜力，为炎症治疗提供了新策略。"}}, {"source": "crossref", "identifier": "10.1111/ggr.70036", "title": "Microanalysis of Hornblende for Fluorine and Chlorine: Impact of Analytical Parameters on Accuracy and Detection Limits", "abstract": "The F and Cl contents in hornblende are critical for geological studies, but their accurate determination by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) faces technical challenges. Existing “dual current” methods for major and trace elements are limited by instrumentation and data volume, and cannot meet large‐scale analytical needs. This study systematically evaluates EPMA parameters to establish general conditions for “single current” in situ determination of major elements, F and Cl in hornblende. Results show optimal F counting stability on TAP/LDE1 crystals at 0–5 μm beam sizes. Long dwell times with high currents reduce DLs to 11 μg g ‐1 (F) and 2 μg g ‐1 (Cl), with BG ± 10 mm yielding lower DLs than ±5 mm. However, currents beyond 100 nA cause loss of major components (notably SiO 2 ), so moderate currents are safer. For hornblende F determination, accuracy prioritises PHA setting > BG correction > probe current > counting time > reference material selection > beam size, whereas Cl is less parameter‐sensitive. A general parameter set for simultaneous in situ major element, F and Cl determination in hornblende is established, with results consistent with literature values for the Kakanui and Arenal hornblende reference materials. This method can be applied to research on magmatic‐hydrothermal evolution, metamorphism and subduction‐zone cycling.", "authors": ["Juan Wang", "Yonghong Shi", "Chunlei Peng", "Guoxin Tang", "Zihan Yi"], "doi": "10.1111/ggr.70036", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ggr.70036", "published": "2026-01-26T05:48:49+00:00", "venue": "Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-27"}, "score": 0.443181265651189, "similarity": 0.4463074425456379, "impact_factor_score": 0.43067655807339306, "impact_factor": 3.0, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "ignore", "translated_title": "角闪石中氟和氯的微区分析：分析参数对准确度和检出限的影响", "domain": null, "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "旨在解决电子探针（EPMA）在“单电流”条件下准确测定角闪石中主量元素及氟、氯含量的技术难题。", "methodology": "通过系统评估束斑、电流和积分时间等EPMA参数，建立了同步测定主量元素和氟、氯的通用分析条件。", "key_findings": "发现PHA设置对氟测定准确度影响最大，适中电流可避免主量元素损失，并实现了氟、氯的低检出限测定。", "innovation": "确立了一套适用于角闪石主量及氟、氯同步分析的“单电流”通用参数，克服了传统“双电流”方法的局限。", "relevance_note": "为岩浆-热液演化、变质作用及俯冲带循环等地质研究提供了高精度、高效率的微区分析技术支持。"}}]}]}
