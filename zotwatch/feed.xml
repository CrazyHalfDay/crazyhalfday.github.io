Metabolic modeling using metagenomic and metabolomic data predicts elevated H 2 oxidation and suppressed H 2 production in the PSY rhizosphere. Assembled genomes of rhizosphere H 2 -oxidizing bacteria are enriched in genes utilizing gluconeogenic acids compared with H 2 -producing counterparts, and their activities are likely stimulated by elevated levels of gluconeogenic acids, primarily amino acids, in PSY root exudates. Overall, our study indicates that decreased CH 4 emissions are due to a lower amount of H 2 available for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and provides a powerful strategy to mitigate CH 4 emissions from increasingly widespread rice cultivation.

Metabolic modeling using metagenomic and metabolomic data predicts elevated H 2 oxidation and suppressed H 2 production in the PSY rhizosphere. Assembled genomes of rhizosphere H 2 -oxidizing bacteria are enriched in genes utilizing gluconeogenic acids compared with H 2 -producing counterparts, and their activities are likely stimulated by elevated levels of gluconeogenic acids, primarily amino acids, in PSY root exudates. Overall, our study indicates that decreased CH 4 emissions are due to a lower amount of H 2 available for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and provides a powerful strategy to mitigate CH 4 emissions from increasingly widespread rice cultivation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Light-induced analgesia provides a drug-free optical method for pain relief via activation of TRAAK k+ channels</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67819-w</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-67819-w</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:02:15 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Marion Bied</dc:creator><dc:creator>Arnaud Landra-Willm</dc:creator><dc:creator>Anne Amandine Chassot</dc:creator><dc:creator>Edward Francisco Mendez-Otalvaro</dc:creator><dc:creator>Benjamin Sueur</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kilian Roßmann</dc:creator><dc:creator>Elvira de la Peña</dc:creator><dc:creator>Pascal Fossat</dc:creator><dc:creator>Stephen J.

These structural data reveal how Rv0097 employs conformational rearrangements to protect the unstable CADA-reaction intermediate that is formed in the first half reaction while swapping out αKG cleavage products for a second molecule of αKG. Additionally, these structures, together with data from site-directed mutagenesis, provide insight into Rv0097’s preference for substrates with long alkyl chains, potentially facilitating efforts to re-engineer ScoE/Rv0097 to synthesize isonitrile functional groups on a wider range of small molecules.

Here, we present CytoTape, a genetically encoded, modular protein tape recorder for multiplexed and spatiotemporally scalable recording of gene regulation dynamics continuously for up to three weeks, physiologically compatible, with single-cell, minutes-scale resolution. CytoTape employs a flexible, thread-like, elongating intracellular protein self-assembly engineered via computationally assisted rational design, built on earlier XRI technology2. We demonstrated its utility across multiple mammalian cell types, achieving simultaneous recording of five transcription factor activities and gene transcriptional activities. CytoTape reveals that divergent transcriptional trajectories correlate with transcriptional history and signal integration, and that distinct immediate early genes (IEGs) exhibit complex temporal correlations within single cells. We further extended CytoTape into CytoTape-vivo for scalable, spatiotemporally resolved single-cell recording in the living brain, enabling simultaneous weeks-long recording of doxycycline- and IEG promoter-dependent gene expression histories across up to 14,123 neurons spanning multiple brain regions per mouse. Together, the CytoTape toolkit establishes a versatile platform for scalable and multiplexed analysis of cell physiological processes in vitro and in vivo.

Previous studies found that large‐scale climate modes such as the Southern Annular Mode and El Niño Southern do not fully account for the interannual variability of dense water formation. Here, we investigate the influence of the overlooked Zonal Wave‐3 (ZW3) mode, characterized by three alternating cyclone–anticyclone pairs in the Southern Hemisphere mid‐latitudes.

The PC1 phase exerts the strongest influence in the Ross Sea, while the PC2 phase can nearly shut down or double dense water formation in the Weddell Sea. A simulation with interannually varying atmospheric forcing confirms ZW3 correlates with dense water formation in both regions.
