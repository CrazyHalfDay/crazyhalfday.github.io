Thermodynamic equilibria, based on the activities obtained from the aqueous speciation, and the isotope composition of the hyperalkaline water were used to estimate the temperature at depth, which appears to be markedly low.

A high-resolution three-dimensional velocity model is essential for multi-scale velocity model construction, source-parameter inversion, simulation of strong ground motion, and seismic hazard assessment.

By joint inversion of these complementary body and surface wave datasets, we determined a high-resolution three-dimensional Vp and Vs model for the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Xinjiang (XJVM-1.0) with a lateral resolution of 50–100 km and a vertical resolution of ∼10 km. XJVM-1.0 reveals that the Tianshan orogen exhibits a relatively rigid upper crust that hosts abundant seismicity under far-field compression, whereas its middle-lower crust accommodates the majority of compressional stress through plastic deformation and/or partial melting. In contrast, the interiors of the Junggar and Tarim basins have experienced negligible internal deformation and are inferred to underthrust beneath the Tianshan orogen in response to the India-Eurasia collision. Relocated seismicity indicates that earthquakes are predominantly concentrated within the Tianshan range, with a notable proportion occurring in the middle-lower crust, implying whole-crust tectonic activity and highlighting the potential for great earthquakes in this region.

Multi-scenario economic assessments reveal that marine shale in the Sichuan Basin exhibits inherent profitability, whereas continental reservoirs require carbon credit integration or optimized production. Current Chinese carbon market prices provide insufficient incentives, implementing region-specific subsidies and enhancing carbon pricing frameworks could unlock this potential, thereby contributing to national carbon neutrality goals and multiple Sustainable Development Goals. China’s shale gas value chain can achieve net-negative carbon emissions through geological sequestration, offering a viable pathway for large-scale decarbonization in the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Geochemical characteristics, formation age, and mechanism of the cold volcano at Muji travertine, Xinjiang</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-025-1766-4</link><guid>10.1007/s11430-025-1766-4</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:01:55 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jiaqi Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ziyang Shen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bin Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhihao Sun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zeyang Zhu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chengqiao Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Liqing Xu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yi Ding</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhengfu Guo</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Science China Earth Sciences</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1007/s11430-025-1766-4</prism:doi><description>This study presents the first systematic investigation of the rock geochemistry, hydrogeochemistry, geochronology, and formation mechanisms of the calcareous travertine-type cold volcano at Muji, Xinjiang.

The Cretaceous Razab unit contains high-Cr# spinel chromitite (0.77–0.82), forearc, and island arc tholeiitic (IAT) lavas, supporting formation during subduction initiation. In contrast, the Eocene Sarv-Abad unit features mylonitized gabbros, syn-extensional dikes, and contemporaneous D-MORB/E-MORB magmatism derived from heterogeneous mantle melting, diagnostic of an Oceanic Core Complex (OCC) in an extensional back-arc. Our results demonstrate that the KWOC was shaped by two distinct geodynamic mechanisms: subduction initiation in the Cretaceous and oceanic core complex formation in the Eocene. Despite ∼50 Myr separation, both units were emplaced during the Miocene closure, suggesting how contrasting mechanisms may have shaped the KWOC. The OCC model also offers a potential resolution to prior ambiguities in the geodynamic evolution of Peri-Arabic ophiolites.

Its most recent caldera-forming eruption occurred ~1400 years ago, with numerous intra-caldera eruptions since. Erupted whole rock compositions are commonly attributed to fractional crystallisation along a single liquid line of descent, but mafic mineral clots indicate mafic recharge and magma mixing also influence whole rock compositions. Geophysical studies identified two low-velocity zones at ~0.5–4 km and 9–15 km beneath the caldera, suggesting a shallow reservoir for evolved magmas and a deeper mafic storage zone. However, uncertainties remain regarding depths, connectivity and temporal evolution of Rabaul’s magma storage zones. We present petrological and thermobarometric analyses of products from the 1937, 1994 and 2014 eruptions at Rabaul. Samples contain two distinct mineral clot types. Mafic mineral clots comprise olivine, high-anorthite plagioclase and high-Mg# clinopyroxene that are out of equilibrium with surrounding matrix glass. Textures include rapid growth rims, olivine replacement by orthopyroxene and reversely zoned clinopyroxene. We interpret these mafic mineral clots as cumulate fragments mobilised from a deep mafic mush by mafic recharge. Intermediate mineral clots contain low-anorthite plagioclase, low-Mg# clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and Ti-magnetite, and occur as macrocrysts in equilibrium with matrix glasses (Mg# 30–40). We interpret these intermediate mineral clots as fragments from a shallower, more evolved mush stored. Binary mixing models demonstrate that eruption products can be reproduced by mixing a mafic magma similar to 1937 basaltic enclaves with a dacitic magma resembling the last caldera-forming deposit. Clinopyroxene-only and clinopyroxene–liquid thermobarometry yield crystallisation pressures of 0.5–5 kbar (~2–20 km) and temperatures of 960–1125 °C, but the models lack the vertical resolution to resolve storage zones separated by ~5 km. Combining geophysical, geochemical and thermobarometric data we propose a refined model of magma storage beneath Rabaul, in which magmas are stored in a complex, vertically extensive magma plumbing system with a heterogeneous but interconnected mush reservoir.

This pattern is generated by reflective cells called iridophores and transparent muscle: light becomes horizontally polarized when reflected by iridophores, and its angle of polarization is then rotated to vertical when transmitted through a birefringent muscle layer. Our findings show the significant contribution of polarization of light to animal communication and reveal that polarization signals—like colorful sexual ornaments—can achieve high conspicuousness through fundamentally different optical mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>A highly dynamic mononuclear non-heme iron enzyme for the two-step isonitrile biosynthesis</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68588-w</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-68588-w</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:55:37 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Naike Ye</dc:creator><dc:creator>Antonio Del Rio Flores</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wenjun Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Catherine L.

The EG‐DIP model contributes to ongoing discussions on inertial permeability by providing a framework to determine , integrate it into Forchheimer law, and suggest a physical basis for estimating . This supports predictive modeling of flow across regimes and identifies as the characteristic medium‐specific property for reliable correlation with porosity, permeability, and grain size. By unifying inertial flow theory through eddy growth dynamics, the EG‐DIP model has direct implications for injection‐induced seismicity, CO 2 storage security, and geothermal energy recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Large declines in organofluorine contamination indicated by subarctic marine mammal tissues</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2524513123</link><guid>10.1073/pnas.2524513123</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 20:01:11 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jennifer M.
