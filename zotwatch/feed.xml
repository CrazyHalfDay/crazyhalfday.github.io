However, poor (electro)chemical compatibility between silicon negative electrodes and solid electrolytes (e.g., Li6PS5Cl) plus sluggish interfacial kinetics severely limits their reversibility and Coulombic efficiency. Here, we propose a surface halogenation strategy that transforms the native amorphous SiO2 passivation layer on silicon particles into a functional Al(Si)OCl composite surface via controlled reaction with AlCl3. This artificial interphase reconciles interfacial incompatibility and enables fast ionic/electronic transport, suppressing irreversible lithium loss. The optimized negative electrode achieves a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.3% in half-cells and 85.6% initial Coulombic efficiency (86.6% with pre-lithiation) in full cells paired with LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2. Enhanced reversibility further delivers long-term cyclability. The optimized negative electrode delivers 86% capacity retention and 99.998% average Coulombic efficiency over 200 cycles. Even at high-loading ( &amp;gt; 10 mAh cm-2, and no adhesives/conductive carbon/electrolyte), it retains 72% capacity after 500 cycles. The full cells maintain 80% capacity after 200 cycles at 1 C, with an average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.95%. The versatility of this halogenation strategy underscores halide chemistry’s broad potential in advancing high-performance, reversible silicon-based solid-state batteries. Silicon negative electrodes in solid-state batteries exhibit poor reversibility. Here, the authors demonstrate surface halogenation engineering that suppresses irreversible lithium loss, achieving 94.3% initial Coulombic efficiency and 72% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 25°C.

&lt;p&gt;Silicon-based solid-state batteries are promising next-generation high-energy-density technologies. However, poor (electro)chemical compatibility between silicon negative electrodes and solid electrolytes (e.g., Li6PS5Cl) plus sluggish interfacial kinetics severely limits their reversibility and Coulombic efficiency. Here, we propose a surface halogenation strategy that transforms the native amorphous SiO2 passivation layer on silicon particles into a functional Al(Si)OCl composite surface via controlled reaction with AlCl3. This artificial interphase reconciles interfacial incompatibility and enables fast ionic/electronic transport, suppressing irreversible lithium loss. The optimized negative electrode achieves a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.3% in half-cells and 85.6% initial Coulombic efficiency (86.6% with pre-lithiation) in full cells paired with LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2. Enhanced reversibility further delivers long-term cyclability. The optimized negative electrode delivers 86% capacity retention and 99.998% average Coulombic efficiency over 200 cycles. Even at high-loading ( &amp;amp;gt; 10 mAh cm-2, and no adhesives/conductive carbon/electrolyte), it retains 72% capacity after 500 cycles. The full cells maintain 80% capacity after 200 cycles at 1 C, with an average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.95%. The versatility of this halogenation strategy underscores halide chemistry’s broad potential in advancing high-performance, reversible silicon-based solid-state batteries. Silicon negative electrodes in solid-state batteries exhibit poor reversibility. Here, the authors demonstrate surface halogenation engineering that suppresses irreversible lithium loss, achieving 94.3% initial Coulombic efficiency and 72% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 25°C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Crustal Sources of Geothermal and Magmatic Activity in the Area of Mutnovsky‐Gorely Volcanic Complex (Kamchatka) Inferred From Ambient Noise Tomography</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025jb032025</link><guid>10.1029/2025jb032025</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:07:36 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>N.

Based on data from in situ sampling, satellite, and reanalysis, pronounced thermal fronts occurred in the subsurface layers but weakened and disappeared toward the surface and deeper layers of the northern South China Sea. Despite differing formation mechanisms (i.e., dipole eddies and warm offshore water intrusion), both frontal zones exhibited substantially higher chlorophyll a (Chl a ) levels than non‐frontal zones (on average, Chl a concentrations increased by 77.78% and inventories rose by 88.56%).

Additionally, evident nitrate (NO 3 − ) loss and isotope enrichment factors ( 15 = 3.4‰ and 18 = 4.5‰) supported that Chl a increase were also associated with NO 3 − assimilation. However, 22.7% of the total NO 3 − pool in frontal zones was from nitrification, representing an increase of 15.2% compared to non‐frontal zones. Elevated regeneration was attributed to enhanced oxygen exchange related to frontal dynamics, as suggested by comparable dissolved oxygen and ammonium levels in both zones, yet with elevated apparent oxygen utilization and NO 3 − in frontal zones. This study highlights that subsurface fronts not only facilitate phytoplankton aggregation but also drive active NO 3 − regeneration, thereby leading to an overestimation of new production in oligotrophic oceans.

Here we combine satellite data with mooring measurements from the South China Sea in 2014 to reveal a rapid decay of oceanic eddies following the passage of typhoons. This decay is accompanied by a substantial generation of internal waves with near-inertial frequency in the ocean interior. The temporal correspondence and quantitatively commensurate energy changes indicate a direct energy transfer from eddy to internal wave field. We propose that typhoon-induced perturbations trigger an adjustment process within the eddy, resulting in energy loss through the radiation of near-inertial waves. Quantitatively supported by numerical model simulations, this mechanism plays a crucial role in the evolution of mesoscale eddies and points to a previously overlooked interior source of oceanic internal waves.

&lt;p&gt;Oceanic mesoscale eddies represent the most energetic component of the ocean circulation; however, their decay routes remain elusive, leaving a key gap in our understanding of the oceanic energy cascade. Here we combine satellite data with mooring measurements from the South China Sea in 2014 to reveal a rapid decay of oceanic eddies following the passage of typhoons. This decay is accompanied by a substantial generation of internal waves with near-inertial frequency in the ocean interior. The temporal correspondence and quantitatively commensurate energy changes indicate a direct energy transfer from eddy to internal wave field. We propose that typhoon-induced perturbations trigger an adjustment process within the eddy, resulting in energy loss through the radiation of near-inertial waves. Quantitatively supported by numerical model simulations, this mechanism plays a crucial role in the evolution of mesoscale eddies and points to a previously overlooked interior source of oceanic internal waves. Mesoscale eddies’ decay is accompanied by subsurface near-inertial wave generation, indicating direct energy transfer, according to remote sensing and in situ measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>A smart nail platform for wireless subsoil health monitoring via unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted radio frequency interrogation</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67889-w</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-67889-w</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:03:16 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Yashwanth Ramesh</dc:creator><dc:creator>Muhammad Masud Rana</dc:creator><dc:creator>Praveen Srinivasan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Akshay Krishnakumar</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sarath Gopalakrishnan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jason Adams</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shalamar Armstrong</dc:creator><dc:creator>Rahim Rahimi</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-67889-w</prism:doi><description>Monitoring subsoil conditions across large agricultural areas is essential for optimizing resource use and supporting sustainable crop production.

Multi-model mean projections indicate an increase in Sahel mean rainfall under greenhouse warming, but how Sahel rainfall interannual variability and extreme seasons might change is unclear. Using the latest generation of climate models, here we find that under a high emission scenario, Sahel rainfall variability increases, featuring a higher frequency of both extreme wet and dry seasons. The increase of rainfall interannual variability is stronger in the central-eastern Sahel than in the western Sahel. The increase in variability is due to several factors, including a projected increase in El Niño-Southern Oscillation variability, which leads to a stronger impact on low-level wind and moisture flux over the Sahel resulting in more extreme seasons, and a higher mean rainfall over the Sahel favoring large&amp;nbsp;anomalies. Thus, the Sahel is likely to experience more extreme wet and dry seasons relative to its warmer and wetter mean climate. This study shows that greenhouse warming is likely to increase interannual rainfall variability in the Sahel, increasing the risk of occurrence of extreme seasonal conditions in the region.

Among brain regions regulating energy homeostasis, the lateral septum has emerged as a critical brake on feeding behavior to prevent overeating. However, the neural adaptations within the septal area under high-fat diet (HFD) and consequent contributions to obesity remain unknown. Utilizing high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing, slice electrophysiology and in vivo calcium imaging, we identified HFD-induced alterations in the transcriptional profiles and neural activity within the septal area of male mice. The HFD suppresses septal neuronal activity by downregulating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 (Hcn1), and weakens inhibitory control over downstream targets through reduced expression of glutamate decarboxylase 2 (Gad2). Overexpression of Hcn1 and Gad2 enhances septal neuronal activity, restores GABA levels, and prevents HFD-driven overeating and obesity. These findings illustrate how diet disrupts the brain’s feeding suppression system, leading to overeating and obesity. How high-fat diet disrupts brain circuits that regulate food intake is unclear. Here, the authors show such a diet downregulates Hcn1 and Gad2 in lateral septum, which in turn disrupts circuit activity and promotes overeating and obesity in mice.

&lt;p&gt;The global epidemic of diet-induced obesity poses a significant health challenge. Among brain regions regulating energy homeostasis, the lateral septum has emerged as a critical brake on feeding behavior to prevent overeating. However, the neural adaptations within the septal area under high-fat diet (HFD) and consequent contributions to obesity remain unknown. Utilizing high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing, slice electrophysiology and in vivo calcium imaging, we identified HFD-induced alterations in the transcriptional profiles and neural activity within the septal area of male mice. The HFD suppresses septal neuronal activity by downregulating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 (Hcn1), and weakens inhibitory control over downstream targets through reduced expression of glutamate decarboxylase 2 (Gad2).
