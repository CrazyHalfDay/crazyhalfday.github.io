Interface viscosity initially rose with cooling, but upon reaching a threshold where major metamorphic minerals changed, dropped from &gt;10 18 to 17 Pa‐s. Cooling‐induced mineral‐mechanical changes thus drove rheological weakening, and provide a general mechanism explaining slab collapse and the transition to self‐sustaining subduction. This implies that strain localization is inherent to modern metamorphosed oceanic lithosphere and does not require a “stress drop.” The next step to understanding subduction initiation is identifying causes of high temperatures and incipient cooling during the pre‐collapse phase.

We use ocean redox, iron isotope (δ 56 Fe), and phosphorus phase partitioning records from shelf and deep-ocean settings to evaluate the drivers behind this major reshaping of the pelagic marine ecosystem. A marked decrease in mesopelagic graptolites coincided with a stepwise negative δ 56 Fe shift on the shelf, driven by partial seawater Fe drawdown resulting from episodic intensification of mid-depth euxinia. Subsequently, a positive δ 56 Fe shift in both deep-ocean and shelf sediments reflects extensive seawater Fe removal during the development of more widespread euxinia. This led to enhanced sedimentary phosphorus recycling from sediments, which ultimately fueled the radiation of epipelagic graptolites. Thus, wide-scale changes in Fe cycling, linking the global oceanic redox state to phosphorus cycling, were ultimately responsible for the initial demise and subsequent radiation of select graptolite species.

&lt;p&gt;Graptolites were abundant and cosmopolitan zooplankton in Early Paleozoic oceans, but a prominent change in species occurred across the Late Ordovician mass extinction. We use ocean redox, iron isotope (δ 56 Fe), and phosphorus phase partitioning records from shelf and deep-ocean settings to evaluate the drivers behind this major reshaping of the pelagic marine ecosystem. A marked decrease in mesopelagic graptolites coincided with a stepwise negative δ 56 Fe shift on the shelf, driven by partial seawater Fe drawdown resulting from episodic intensification of mid-depth euxinia. Subsequently, a positive δ 56 Fe shift in both deep-ocean and shelf sediments reflects extensive seawater Fe removal during the development of more widespread euxinia.

Solid-state caloric refrigeration offers a low-carbon alternative5–7, but its practical deployment has been hindered by limited cooling capacity and the inefficient indirect heat transfer that requires secondary fluids. Here we report an extreme barocaloric effect in NH4SCN aqueous solutions enabled by pressure-tuned dissolution and precipitation. This mechanism delivers an exceptionally large cooling capacity and markedly enhanced cooling efficiency. We obtain an in situ temperature drop of 26.8 K in the solution at room temperature, surpassing all known caloric materials. A Carnot-like cycle is designed to deliver 67 J g−1 cooling capacity per cycle with a second-law efficiency of 77%, benefiting from the extremely large temperature drops and direct heat transfer due to the self-circulating aqueous solution. Beyond the phase-transition scenario, this dissolution-based approach that combines the merits of current leading technologies emerges as a promising sustainable refrigeration solution. An extreme barocaloric effect in NH4SCN aqueous solutions is enabled by pressure-induced dissolution and precipitation, but without using a separate heat-transfer liquid.

&lt;p&gt;Refrigeration is indispensable to modern society1, yet the dominant vapour-compression systems rely on environmentally harmful fluorocarbon refrigerants with high global warming potential2–4. Solid-state caloric refrigeration offers a low-carbon alternative5–7, but its practical deployment has been hindered by limited cooling capacity and the inefficient indirect heat transfer that requires secondary fluids. Here we report an extreme barocaloric effect in NH4SCN aqueous solutions enabled by pressure-tuned dissolution and precipitation. This mechanism delivers an exceptionally large cooling capacity and markedly enhanced cooling efficiency. We obtain an in situ temperature drop of 26.8 K in the solution at room temperature, surpassing all known caloric materials. A Carnot-like cycle is designed to deliver 67 J g−1 cooling capacity per cycle with a second-law efficiency of 77%, benefiting from the extremely large temperature drops and direct heat transfer due to the self-circulating aqueous solution. Beyond the phase-transition scenario, this dissolution-based approach that combines the merits of current leading technologies emerges as a promising sustainable refrigeration solution. An extreme barocaloric effect in NH4SCN aqueous solutions is enabled by pressure-induced dissolution and precipitation, but without using a separate heat-transfer liquid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Lithospheric Magnetization Derived From Petrological and Satellite Constraints</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025jb032111</link><guid>10.1029/2025jb032111</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 08:23:52 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Yi Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shida Sun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Walter D.

This approach enables supramolecular assembly to achieve π-π coupling-mediated horizontal dipole alignment in nanocluster solid films, allowing an external quantum efficiency of up to 26.4% in flexible light-emitting diodes with a maximum brightness of 41,365 cd m−2, and retaining more than 94% of initial efficiency after 2000 bending cycles at 3 mm curvature radius. Metal nanoclusters are promising for flexible light-emitting diodes but face efficiency and stability challenges. Here, the authors employ a π-conjugated mediator to align dipole alignment, yielding devices with 26.4% external quantum efficiency and 94% efficiency retention after 2000 bending cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The Age and Composition of the Voyager Seamounts: Evidence for a Long‐Lived Marquesas Mantle Source</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025gc012650</link><guid>10.1029/2025gc012650</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 14:01:26 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andrea Balbas</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hannah Paradis</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kevin Konrad</dc:creator><dc:creator>Valerie A.
