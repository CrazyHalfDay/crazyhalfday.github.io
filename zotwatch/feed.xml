XJVM-1.0 reveals that the Tianshan orogen exhibits a relatively rigid upper crust that hosts abundant seismicity under far-field compression, whereas its middle-lower crust accommodates the majority of compressional stress through plastic deformation and/or partial melting. In contrast, the interiors of the Junggar and Tarim basins have experienced negligible internal deformation and are inferred to underthrust beneath the Tianshan orogen in response to the India-Eurasia collision. Relocated seismicity indicates that earthquakes are predominantly concentrated within the Tianshan range, with a notable proportion occurring in the middle-lower crust, implying whole-crust tectonic activity and highlighting the potential for great earthquakes in this region.

Erosion of monazite-bearing slates and phyllites, and short-range transport resulted in localised recent alluvial deposits rich in millimetre-size monazite, of which the Matamulas site, within the Central Iberian Zone, represents one of the most extensive and potentially exploitable placer-type accumulations of Th-poor grey monazite in western Europe. Nodular monazite from the Matamulas area depicts spheroidal or triaxial ellipsoid shapes and is mostly greyish, although it may display different surface colours from yellow to black. The nodules contain abundant silicate (quartz, feldspar, white mica, chlorite, zircon) and Fe oxides-hydroxides, organic matter, rutile and Mn oxide inclusions, generally oriented at random or showing orientations related to original bedding anisotropy. Nodular monazite displays concentric optical zoning, continuous or oscillatory, associated with the abundance and nature of inclusions. Chemical zoning is typically progressive, with cores enriched in medium and heavy rare earth elements (REE), and rims rich in light REE (La-Ce). Substitution of Pr by La-Ce is decoupled from that of elements with smaller ionic radii. Thorium contents are low (estimated mean 0.16 wt % ThO2) and irregularly distributed across the monazite nodules. The increased concentration of phyllosilicate and other inclusions toward nodule rims, the sparse occurrence of twinning and the observed chemical zoning suggest progressive recrystallisation and refining from precursor gels or cryptocrystalline aggregates, facilitated by localized fluid-assisted element mobility during nodule growth. U-Pb dating of monazite yields an Early Devonian age of ca. 400&amp;nbsp;Ma, significantly older than the Upper Carboniferous age of regional metamorphism and tectonic foliation in the host metasediments. The age obtained, together with their non-oriented growth within specific levels of the sedimentary pile, indicates that the process of formation of nodular monazite took place through diagenesis or burial metamorphism. Although nodular monazite is absent from equivalent stratigraphic units in more internal zones of the Iberian Massif, its occurrence over a broad area of western Europe warrants further exploration for placer-type monazite deposits analogous to those at Matamulas in comparable geomorphological settings.

&lt;p&gt;Authigenic nodular monazite occurs in dark, Middle Ordovician, low-grade metapelites of the Central Iberian and West Asturian-Leonese Zones of the Iberian Massif. Erosion of monazite-bearing slates and phyllites, and short-range transport resulted in localised recent alluvial deposits rich in millimetre-size monazite, of which the Matamulas site, within the Central Iberian Zone, represents one of the most extensive and potentially exploitable placer-type accumulations of Th-poor grey monazite in western Europe. Nodular monazite from the Matamulas area depicts spheroidal or triaxial ellipsoid shapes and is mostly greyish, although it may display different surface colours from yellow to black. The nodules contain abundant silicate (quartz, feldspar, white mica, chlorite, zircon) and Fe oxides-hydroxides, organic matter, rutile and Mn oxide inclusions, generally oriented at random or showing orientations related to original bedding anisotropy. Nodular monazite displays concentric optical zoning, continuous or oscillatory, associated with the abundance and nature of inclusions. Chemical zoning is typically progressive, with cores enriched in medium and heavy rare earth elements (REE), and rims rich in light REE (La-Ce). Substitution of Pr by La-Ce is decoupled from that of elements with smaller ionic radii. Thorium contents are low (estimated mean 0.16 wt % ThO2) and irregularly distributed across the monazite nodules. The increased concentration of phyllosilicate and other inclusions toward nodule rims, the sparse occurrence of twinning and the observed chemical zoning suggest progressive recrystallisation and refining from precursor gels or cryptocrystalline aggregates, facilitated by localized fluid-assisted element mobility during nodule growth. U-Pb dating of monazite yields an Early Devonian age of ca. 400&amp;amp;nbsp;Ma, significantly older than the Upper Carboniferous age of regional metamorphism and tectonic foliation in the host metasediments. The age obtained, together with their non-oriented growth within specific levels of the sedimentary pile, indicates that the process of formation of nodular monazite took place through diagenesis or burial metamorphism. Although nodular monazite is absent from equivalent stratigraphic units in more internal zones of the Iberian Massif, its occurrence over a broad area of western Europe warrants further exploration for placer-type monazite deposits analogous to those at Matamulas in comparable geomorphological settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Carbon sequestration for geological negative emissions of the shale gas value chain in China</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68829-y</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-68829-y</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 06:03:16 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Pu Hong</dc:creator><dc:creator>Meiyu Guo</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sai Liang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wenrui Shi</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yumeng Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xi Lu</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-026-68829-y</prism:doi><description>Carbon sequestration in shale gas operations represents a crucial pathway to achieve Geological Negative Emissions, which is essential for global 1.5 °C targets.

The Cretaceous Razab unit contains high-Cr# spinel chromitite (0.77–0.82), forearc, and island arc tholeiitic (IAT) lavas, supporting formation during subduction initiation. In contrast, the Eocene Sarv-Abad unit features mylonitized gabbros, syn-extensional dikes, and contemporaneous D-MORB/E-MORB magmatism derived from heterogeneous mantle melting, diagnostic of an Oceanic Core Complex (OCC) in an extensional back-arc. Our results demonstrate that the KWOC was shaped by two distinct geodynamic mechanisms: subduction initiation in the Cretaceous and oceanic core complex formation in the Eocene. Despite ∼50 Myr separation, both units were emplaced during the Miocene closure, suggesting how contrasting mechanisms may have shaped the KWOC.

We present a 3D shear‐wave anisotropy model obtained by inverting 7,985 SKS splitting intensity measurements from 261 broadband stations using 941 events from 2000 to 2023. Our multi‐scale model resolves lateral and vertical variations of shear‐wave azimuthal anisotropy. In the subduction zone, the fast axis in the sub‐slab mantle below the forearc and offshore regions changes with depth from trench‐normal to trench‐parallel, in agreement with predictions of geodynamic model for retreating slabs. In the asthenosphere below the backarc region, fast axes are mainly oriented northeast–southwest, which is consistent with southwestward mantle flow and extrusion tectonics, and suggests strong lithosphere–asthenosphere coupling.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Alaska&amp;#x27;s tectonic complexity makes it ideal for probing upper mantle deformation. We present a 3D shear‐wave anisotropy model obtained by inverting 7,985 SKS splitting intensity measurements from 261 broadband stations using 941 events from 2000 to 2023. Our multi‐scale model resolves lateral and vertical variations of shear‐wave azimuthal anisotropy. In the subduction zone, the fast axis in the sub‐slab mantle below the forearc and offshore regions changes with depth from trench‐normal to trench‐parallel, in agreement with predictions of geodynamic model for retreating slabs. In the asthenosphere below the backarc region, fast axes are mainly oriented northeast–southwest, which is consistent with southwestward mantle flow and extrusion tectonics, and suggests strong lithosphere–asthenosphere coupling. Anisotropy weakens below ∼200 km, indicating an increased vertical olivine alignment due to slab steepening. A two‐layer anisotropic structure in the backarc region suggests the presence of lithosphere fabrics unrelated to recent dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Magmatic degassing as the primary source of salt in Archean oceans</title><link>https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/11513/download/20829/</link><guid>oai:EA:id:11513</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 12:13:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ranta, Eemu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fusswinkel, Tobias</dc:creator><dc:creator>Beier, Christoph</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bali, Eniko</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>EarthArXiv</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.31223/X52472</prism:doi><description>The salinification of Earth’s early oceans impacted both the climate and the evolution of life.

Here, we present new triple halogen (Cl-Br-I) data from high temperature (~750–840 °C) fluid inclusions from a gabbroic intrusion in Iceland. Our data show that the magmatic degassing fractionates the halogens and generates fluids with high Br/Cl and I/Cl that match with Archean seawater.

A crater lava unit dated at 25.2 ± 3.8 ka is overlain by considerably younger crater lavas dated at 7.9 ± 7.7 and 5.7 ± 4.4 ka. A hornblende-gabbro xenolith is dated at 475.6 ± 28.3 ka, in agreement with early pre-Somma magmatism at La Soufrière volcano, and possibly representing an earlier, now inactive, crystal-mush. Combing new and published data, we show that hiatuses in the geochronological record coincide with major summit collapse events and that the system appears to have stabilised compositionally after the most recent Somma collapse.

However, the chemical maps are often used to analyze pre‐defined regions based on mapped geology and/or mineralogy. Previous mapping works have relied on first‐principles methods like principal component analyses and k‐means clustering. In response, we adapt dimensionality reduction and multivariate clustering methods to analyze the spatial variability of nine key elements in martian geochemical maps. We identify seven individually contiguous chemical provinces, nearly exclusively in the highlands. We then conduct geochemical analysis coupled with first order petrological modeling to assess the histories for individually delineated provinces. We identified two new regions where one is consistent with minimal chemical weathering and represents a ∼3.7 Ga old crustal block preserving compositional evidence of fractional crystallization, suggestive of Mars's primary crust sequestering early as a magma ocean solidified.

However, the chemical maps are often used to analyze pre‐defined regions based on mapped geology and/or mineralogy. Previous mapping works have relied on first‐principles methods like principal component analyses and k‐means clustering. In response, we adapt dimensionality reduction and multivariate clustering methods to analyze the spatial variability of nine key elements in martian geochemical maps. We identify seven individually contiguous chemical provinces, nearly exclusively in the highlands. We then conduct geochemical analysis coupled with first order petrological modeling to assess the histories for individually delineated provinces. We identified two new regions where one is consistent with minimal chemical weathering and represents a ∼3.7 Ga old crustal block preserving compositional evidence of fractional crystallization, suggestive of Mars&amp;#x27;s primary crust sequestering early as a magma ocean solidified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Soil carbon debt from land use change in Brazil</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68340-4</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-68340-4</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 06:03:07 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>João M.

Its most recent caldera-forming eruption occurred ~1400 years ago, with numerous intra-caldera eruptions since. Erupted whole rock compositions are commonly attributed to fractional crystallisation along a single liquid line of descent, but mafic mineral clots indicate mafic recharge and magma mixing also influence whole rock compositions. Geophysical studies identified two low-velocity zones at ~0.5–4 km and 9–15 km beneath the caldera, suggesting a shallow reservoir for evolved magmas and a deeper mafic storage zone. However, uncertainties remain regarding depths, connectivity and temporal evolution of Rabaul’s magma storage zones. We present petrological and thermobarometric analyses of products from the 1937, 1994 and 2014 eruptions at Rabaul. Samples contain two distinct mineral clot types. Mafic mineral clots comprise olivine, high-anorthite plagioclase and high-Mg# clinopyroxene that are out of equilibrium with surrounding matrix glass. Textures include rapid growth rims, olivine replacement by orthopyroxene and reversely zoned clinopyroxene. We interpret these mafic mineral clots as cumulate fragments mobilised from a deep mafic mush by mafic recharge. Intermediate mineral clots contain low-anorthite plagioclase, low-Mg# clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and Ti-magnetite, and occur as macrocrysts in equilibrium with matrix glasses (Mg# 30–40). We interpret these intermediate mineral clots as fragments from a shallower, more evolved mush stored. Binary mixing models demonstrate that eruption products can be reproduced by mixing a mafic magma similar to 1937 basaltic enclaves with a dacitic magma resembling the last caldera-forming deposit. Clinopyroxene-only and clinopyroxene–liquid thermobarometry yield crystallisation pressures of 0.5–5 kbar (~2–20 km) and temperatures of 960–1125 °C, but the models lack the vertical resolution to resolve storage zones separated by ~5 km. Combining geophysical, geochemical and thermobarometric data we propose a refined model of magma storage beneath Rabaul, in which magmas are stored in a complex, vertically extensive magma plumbing system with a heterogeneous but interconnected mush reservoir.

We examined diel variability in zooplankton fecal pellet flux in the subarctic Northeast Pacific using two image-based tools: the Underwater Vision Profiler (UVP5) and upward-facing cameras (GelCam) on a surface-tethered sediment trap array. Three fecal pellet types were classified across both platforms, enabling complementary estimates of pellet abundance, modeled carbon content, and flux. Daily composites revealed distinct diel patterns in three zooplankton types (crustacea, salps, and appendicularia) and their associated pellet flux. A simple model linking zooplankton vertical migration and pellet production, sinking, and attenuation reproduced the observed temporal variability for the migrators. A compelling diel pattern in appendicularian pellets warrants further investigation. Together, these results highlight how diel behavior and physiology impact vertical carbon transport.

&lt;p&gt;The contribution of sinking fecal pellets to the biological carbon pump depends on pellet properties, producer abundance, and the depth and timing of pellet production, which can be modulated by diel vertical migration. We examined diel variability in zooplankton fecal pellet flux in the subarctic Northeast Pacific using two image-based tools: the Underwater Vision Profiler (UVP5) and upward-facing cameras (GelCam) on a surface-tethered sediment trap array. Three fecal pellet types were classified across both platforms, enabling complementary estimates of pellet abundance, modeled carbon content, and flux. Daily composites revealed distinct diel patterns in three zooplankton types (crustacea, salps, and appendicularia) and their associated pellet flux. A simple model linking zooplankton vertical migration and pellet production, sinking, and attenuation reproduced the observed temporal variability for the migrators. A compelling diel pattern in appendicularian pellets warrants further investigation. Together, these results highlight how diel behavior and physiology impact vertical carbon transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>A highly dynamic mononuclear non-heme iron enzyme for the two-step isonitrile biosynthesis</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68588-w</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-68588-w</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:55:37 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Naike Ye</dc:creator><dc:creator>Antonio Del Rio Flores</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wenjun Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Catherine L.

These structural data reveal how Rv0097 employs conformational rearrangements to protect the unstable CADA-reaction intermediate that is formed in the first half reaction while swapping out αKG cleavage products for a second molecule of αKG. Additionally, these structures, together with data from site-directed mutagenesis, provide insight into Rv0097’s preference for substrates with long alkyl chains, potentially facilitating efforts to re-engineer ScoE/Rv0097 to synthesize isonitrile functional groups on a wider range of small molecules.
