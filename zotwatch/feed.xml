The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts. We propose that subducted oceanic crust plays a role similar to that of subducted sediments in recycling FME, such as K, Rb, and Ba, owing to the buffering effect of phengite. Nevertheless, it potentially contributes more significantly to Sr enrichment within the mantle wedge of subduction zones.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Seismic anisotropy in the Earth’s lower mantle, particularly around subduction zones, is commonly attributed to deformation by dislocation creep, yet much of the lower mantle appears nearly isotropic. This contrast complicates interpretations of mantle rheology. Here we report the temperature dependence of lattice preferred orientation in bridgmanite, the most abundant lower mantle mineral, through high-pressure deformation experiments at 25 gigapascals and 1700–2100 kelvin. Both iron-free and iron-bearing bridgmanite develop lattice preferred orientations across this temperature range, with distinct slip systems occurring below and above 1800 kelvin. Low-temperature fabric produces strong seismic anisotropy, whereas high-temperature fabric yields weak, near-isotropic signatures under horizontal shearing. These results provide a unified explanation for strong seismic anisotropy near subduction zones and globally near-isotropic behavior of the lower mantle. They suggest that dislocation creep could dominate lower mantle deformation while generating diverse seismic signatures, providing important understanding for lower mantle rheology and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The effect of fluorine in the genesis of carbonatite-hosted rare earth element and niobium deposits</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-025-1735-0</link><guid>10.1007/s11430-025-1735-0</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 02:27:15 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Wanzhu Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shuo Xue</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ming-Xing Ling</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xing Ding</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Science China Earth Sciences</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1007/s11430-025-1735-0</prism:doi><description>Carbonatite is a rare but highly prospective rock that plays a significant role as a source of critical metals, notably rare earth elements (REE) and niobium (Nb).

The lack of covariance between δ 98/95 Mo and differentiation index Mg# argues against magmatic differentiation governing Mo isotopic fractionation. Most samples show a sharp decline in δ 98/95 Mo values with decreasing Mo/Ce ratios, far below mantle values, suggesting that fluid leaching is responsible for the observed Mo isotope fractionation. Based on newly obtained Mo isotope data for these Mesozoic xenoliths, the juvenile lower crust beneath the Cathaysia Block is enriched in extremely light Mo isotopes compared to the mantle. It is proposed that widely distributed fluids in the crust may be an important reservoir for balancing Earth's Mo isotope system. In this context, molybdenum isotope fingerprinting of fluid activities constitutes a significant approach for investigating crustal differentiation.

Py2c is As-Cu-Pb-Ag-Au-rich (initial gold enrichment), suggestive of fluid boiling during its formation, corroborated by low δ 34 S values (avg. −3.83‰) and hydrothermal breccias. In contrast, Py2r is depleted in these elements, indicative of non-boiling conditions, further supported by heavier δ 34 S values (avg. −2.53‰). Several pieces of evidence, including sharp reaction fronts and As-Au contents differences between Py2c and Py3, and Py2c remnants and mineral inclusions (chalcopyrite, galena, and native gold) within Py3, indicate the CDR process, during which Au in Py2c was remobilized and reprecipitated as native gold. The CDR process is triggered by oxidation of the mineralizing fluids, consistent with the decreasing δ 34 S values from Py2r to Py3. Combined with higher Co-Ni concentrations in Py3 (similar to Py2c) relative to Py2r, we infer that fluid oxidation is associated with hydraulic fracturing restart. Multiple sulfur isotopes (δ 34 S: −4.92 to 0.45‰; Δ 33 S: −0.05 ± 0.10‰) and low Co-Ni and high Se contents of pyrite suggest a magmatic fluid origin from a possible concealed intrusion. This study underscores magmatic-hydrothermal contributions in forming lode gold deposits in Dayaoshan, and highlights the importance of pressure-driven hydrothermal processes in initial gold precipitation, remobilization, and reprecipitation within gold deposits.

With more than 0.7 million tonnes (Mt) of Zn reserves at average grades ranging from 4–8%, the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field comprises representative deposits such as those of Caiyuanhe, Heli, and Qingshuitang. The ore bodies, which exhibit stratiform, vein-like, and lenticular forms, are hosted within the Cambrian Qingxudong Formation dolomite and are spatially associated with the NE-trending Mandong fault. This Zn ore field in Southwest China is a classic example of Zn-rich mineralization. However, the genetic mechanisms and processes responsible for the Zn-rich nature of these MVT Pb‒Zn deposits remain poorly understood. This study aims to characterize Zn mineralization in the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field, Southwest China. The rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol2) from the syn-ore stage vary between 5.63 and 32.50 ppm (with an average of 14.07 ppm), whereas in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol3) from post-ore stage, the values range from 45.63 to 95.69 ppm (with an average of 72.03 ppm). The fluid inclusions of Dol2 and Dol3 exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 98–204°C (with an average of 143°C) and 98–195°C (with an average of 132°C), with corresponding salinity ranges of 13.0–29.5 wt% (with an average of 20.9 wt%) and 16.0–25.7 wt% (with an average of 18.9 wt%) NaCl equivalent, respectively. Sphalerite inclusions exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 95–230°C (with a mean of 143°C) and salinities ranging from 13.8–28.9 wt% (with a mean of 23.7 wt%) NaCl. The δ 13 C fluid , δ D fluid , and δ 18 O fluid values of the ore-forming fluids range from -4.4‰ to -3.8‰ (with a mean of -4.1‰), -36.4‰ to -27.8‰ (with a mean of -31.9‰), and 4.9‰ to 5.7‰ (with a mean of 5.3‰), respectively. In this study, an Fe- and Zn-enriched NaCl-H₂O basement brine is identified as the ore-forming fluid responsible for the Zn-rich MVT deposits. During its low- to medium-temperature migration, the fluid was channelled by the Mandong fault and Wangsi anticline structural framework, which provided ideal pathways and traps. During migration, the fluid leached sulfur (reduced from evaporites to H 2 S) from wall rocks and ultimately precipitated within dolomite faults and fractures. The distinct Zn-rich character of the deposits stems from the following two key factors: a primary derivation from the Zn-rich basement of the Yangtze Block and a chemical preference for Zn enrichment, which is driven by the differing fractionation coefficients of Zn- and Pb-chloride complexes in the NaCl–H 2 O system. This study advances the understanding of the genesis of MVT deposits worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;Although Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposit mineralization processes are well characterized, the associated ore-forming fluids, which are crucial to understanding Pb and Zn mineralization, should be investigated further. With more than 0.7 million tonnes (Mt) of Zn reserves at average grades ranging from 4–8%, the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field comprises representative deposits such as those of Caiyuanhe, Heli, and Qingshuitang. The ore bodies, which exhibit stratiform, vein-like, and lenticular forms, are hosted within the Cambrian Qingxudong Formation dolomite and are spatially associated with the NE-trending Mandong fault. This Zn ore field in Southwest China is a classic example of Zn-rich mineralization. However, the genetic mechanisms and processes responsible for the Zn-rich nature of these MVT Pb‒Zn deposits remain poorly understood. This study aims to characterize Zn mineralization in the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field, Southwest China. The rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol2) from the syn-ore stage vary between 5.63 and 32.50 ppm (with an average of 14.07 ppm), whereas in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol3) from post-ore stage, the values range from 45.63 to 95.69 ppm (with an average of 72.03 ppm). The fluid inclusions of Dol2 and Dol3 exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 98–204°C (with an average of 143°C) and 98–195°C (with an average of 132°C), with corresponding salinity ranges of 13.0–29.5 wt% (with an average of 20.9 wt%) and 16.0–25.7 wt% (with an average of 18.9 wt%) NaCl equivalent, respectively. Sphalerite inclusions exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 95–230°C (with a mean of 143°C) and salinities ranging from 13.8–28.9 wt% (with a mean of 23.7 wt%) NaCl. The δ 13 C fluid , δ D fluid , and δ 18 O fluid values of the ore-forming fluids range from -4.4‰ to -3.8‰ (with a mean of -4.1‰), -36.4‰ to -27.8‰ (with a mean of -31.9‰), and 4.9‰ to 5.7‰ (with a mean of 5.3‰), respectively. In this study, an Fe- and Zn-enriched NaCl-H₂O basement brine is identified as the ore-forming fluid responsible for the Zn-rich MVT deposits. During its low- to medium-temperature migration, the fluid was channelled by the Mandong fault and Wangsi anticline structural framework, which provided ideal pathways and traps. During migration, the fluid leached sulfur (reduced from evaporites to H 2 S) from wall rocks and ultimately precipitated within dolomite faults and fractures. The distinct Zn-rich character of the deposits stems from the following two key factors: a primary derivation from the Zn-rich basement of the Yangtze Block and a chemical preference for Zn enrichment, which is driven by the differing fractionation coefficients of Zn- and Pb-chloride complexes in the NaCl–H 2 O system. This study advances the understanding of the genesis of MVT deposits worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Generation of ferroan (“A-type”) granite in a subduction zone setting: Petrology of the Golden Horn batholith, North Cascades, Washington, USA</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1130/b38681.1</link><guid>10.1130/b38681.1</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:47:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jeffrey H.

The along-ridge 3 He/ 4 He peak at 59-62°N is significantly longer (320 km) than the thickened oceanic crust of VSR-1 (60-70 km). This can most simply be explained if the hot mantle blob is surrounded by a high 3 He/ 4 He mantle carapace that has a temperature similar to the surrounding mantle. As helium diffusion is orders of magnitude slower than heat, this relationship can be most simply explained if the outer region of the hot, He-rich blob has lost heat to the surrounding mantle during transit from the core-mantle boundary, yet retained the deep mantle He isotope fingerprint.

As helium diffusion is orders of magnitude slower than heat, this relationship can be most simply explained if the outer region of the hot, He-rich blob has lost heat to the surrounding mantle during transit from the core-mantle boundary, yet retained the deep mantle He isotope fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Si Isotope Fractionation in Metamorphic Rocks From Cryogenic Temperature Crystallographic Data and Quantum Phonon Model</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025jb032675</link><guid>10.1029/2025jb032675</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 10:41:22 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dongzhou Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ming Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bin Chen</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1029/2025jb032675</prism:doi><description>Abstract In this study, we demonstrate that it is possible to fit the resilience at the high temperature limit using only the atomic mean square displacement determined from cryogenic temperature single crystal diffraction data.

The limited exhumation corresponds to weak deformation within the inner zone. Integrating geological and geophysical data, we suggest that the late Permian plume activity emplaced voluminous mantle-derived mafic-ultramafic intrusions into the crust beneath the ELIP’s inner zone, increasing crustal rigidity and resistance to Cenozoic deformation and exhumation. Our findings highlight how plume-related lithospheric modification may exert a lasting influence on intraplate deformation, persisting hundreds of millions of years after plume cessation.

Relocated seismicity indicates that earthquakes are predominantly concentrated within the Tianshan range, with a notable proportion occurring in the middle-lower crust, implying whole-crust tectonic activity and highlighting the potential for great earthquakes in this region.

Samples were collected from the King Zn deposit of the Eastern Goldfields superterrane, Yilgarn craton, which was metamorphosed to the amphibolite facies. In situ chlorite-white mica chemical trends match the shifting positions of the 2,200W and 2,250W absorption features obtained by short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy. These include a shift from muscovite to Na muscovite in the felsic footwall approaching mineralization, to phengite in the hanging wall, and mostly mixed Fe-Mg chlorite compositions with shifts to Mg-rich chlorite in the Mg-metasomatized felsic footwall. Fluorine (up to 2,500 ppm) and Mn (up to 1.1 wt %) contents of chlorite increase systematically through the footwall of the deposit toward the massive sulfide but drop sharply in the hanging wall—a trend mirrored in F contents in white mica (up to 2,500 ppm) and Mn in garnet (up to 17 wt %). These variations are attributed to premetamorphic footwall metasomatism and can trace hydrothermal up-flow zones in metamorphosed VHMS systems. Thermal infrared (TIR) signatures (11,100W and 11,300DW) correlate negatively with almandine and positively with spessartine contents in garnet, while rare earth element (REE) profiles of garnet further aid in the assessment of VHMS prospectivity. Positive Eu anomalies and downward-dipping heavy rare earth element (HREE) profiles in garnet enriched in the almandine end member distinguish mineralization-related garnet from those of barren metamorphic or igneous origins. Several elements, including Sr-Ba-Rb contents in white mica, Al in chlorite, and Ca-Mn with positive Eu anomalies in garnet, also differentiate footwall from least altered hanging-wall units. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating chlorite, white mica, and garnet chemistry with hyperspectral data for regional VHMS exploration in high-grade metamorphic terranes.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract This study assesses the potential of chlorite, white mica, and garnet chemistry, coupled with hyperspectral data, as vectoring tools in metamorphosed volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits. Samples were collected from the King Zn deposit of the Eastern Goldfields superterrane, Yilgarn craton, which was metamorphosed to the amphibolite facies. In situ chlorite-white mica chemical trends match the shifting positions of the 2,200W and 2,250W absorption features obtained by short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy. These include a shift from muscovite to Na muscovite in the felsic footwall approaching mineralization, to phengite in the hanging wall, and mostly mixed Fe-Mg chlorite compositions with shifts to Mg-rich chlorite in the Mg-metasomatized felsic footwall. Fluorine (up to 2,500 ppm) and Mn (up to 1.1 wt %) contents of chlorite increase systematically through the footwall of the deposit toward the massive sulfide but drop sharply in the hanging wall—a trend mirrored in F contents in white mica (up to 2,500 ppm) and Mn in garnet (up to 17 wt %). These variations are attributed to premetamorphic footwall metasomatism and can trace hydrothermal up-flow zones in metamorphosed VHMS systems. Thermal infrared (TIR) signatures (11,100W and 11,300DW) correlate negatively with almandine and positively with spessartine contents in garnet, while rare earth element (REE) profiles of garnet further aid in the assessment of VHMS prospectivity. Positive Eu anomalies and downward-dipping heavy rare earth element (HREE) profiles in garnet enriched in the almandine end member distinguish mineralization-related garnet from those of barren metamorphic or igneous origins. Several elements, including Sr-Ba-Rb contents in white mica, Al in chlorite, and Ca-Mn with positive Eu anomalies in garnet, also differentiate footwall from least altered hanging-wall units. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating chlorite, white mica, and garnet chemistry with hyperspectral data for regional VHMS exploration in high-grade metamorphic terranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Long-period microseismicity reveals cryptic earthquake-triggered fluid activity can facilitate caldera eruptions</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68645-4</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-68645-4</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:05:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Zilin Song</dc:creator><dc:creator>Andrew F.

Instead, long-period earthquake swarms revealed post-seismic fluid activity along reservoir-bounding faults in the northwestern caldera, locally promoting edifice failure and facilitating magma intrusion that initiated 8 hours later. These observations demonstrate that even when a pressurized reservoir experiences significant stress perturbation, cascading processes could potentially be essential to initiate volcanic eruptions.

This work presents a case study from the Mikir Hills, NE India, utilizing zircon U-Pb geochronology, mineral chemistry, and geochemical thermodynamic modeling constraints to understand the origin and relationship of ca. 508 Ma high-K monzogranites, granites, and HSGs.

The redox calculations (ΔNNO −0.3 to −0.1) and thermometry results (∼880−902 °C) using amphibole chemistry show oxidized and high-temperature conditions for monzogranites. The monzogranites’ high K2O and large-ion lithophile elements suggest the role of a sediment-derived enriched mantle source in their origin. The rhyolite-MELTS and Magma Chamber Simulator modeling results suggest the monzogranites’ parental melt resulted from a silicic metasomatized phlogopite-stabilized lithospheric mantle wedge that underwent subsequent lower crust assimilation. The polybaric (∼6−4 kbar) crystallization of the generated assimilated melt formed the monzogranites with plagioclase and K-feldspar as the dominant crystallizing phase (&amp;gt;50%). Plagioclase-melt equilibrium tests yield slightly higher liquid-only saturation temperatures than plagioclase-liquid pairs, indicating progressive crystallization and melt extraction. The rhyolite-MELTS geobarometer suggests the highly felsic melts separated from the crystal mush between ∼3.8 kbar and 2.8 kbar and emplaced at subvolcanic levels as failed rhyolite eruptions. We suggest the HSGs represent extracted evolved melt, while monzogranites represent residual silicic cumulates formed in a syn- to postcollisional setting during Gondwana assembly.
