The THg (total Hg) content in sulfides and chlorite decreases with increasing distance from the mineralization center, reflecting the variable influence of magmatic volatiles released from the underlying magmatic system, while fluid boiling likely leads to significant variations in δ 202 Hg (exceeding 2‰). The elevated Fe 3+ /∑Fe values, distinct Hg and Sn enrichments, and high formation temperatures (above 400 °C) recorded by Hg-rich chlorite suggest that acidic, hot, oxidized, metal-rich volatiles facilitate the transport of Cu and S from the magmatic to the hydrothermal environment, promoting the formation of large VMS deposits. We propose that the Early Devonian extensional setting enabled oxidized magmatism and volatiles, facilitating efficient Cu and S transport, during which the metal-rich magmatic-hydrothermal fluids (Δ 199 Hg ≈ 0) mixed with seawater (Δ 199 Hg &gt; 0) and continental sediments (Δ 199 Hg 199 Hg range. Consequently, our results indicate Hg isotopes and the chemical composition and Fe redox states of chlorite can be applied to reveal metal source and mineralization processes in ancient VMS deposits and may also serve as a valuable exploration guide for VMS systems.

Consequently, our results indicate Hg isotopes and the chemical composition and Fe redox states of chlorite can be applied to reveal metal source and mineralization processes in ancient VMS deposits and may also serve as a valuable exploration guide for VMS systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Mantle source of the high-Ti magma in the Emeishan large igneous province is oxidized</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egag012</link><guid>10.1093/petrology/egag012</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 12:35:58 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Zhong-Jie Bai</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wei-Guang Zhu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jian-Feng Gao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guang-Shao Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shi-Ji Zheng</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Journal of Petrology</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1093/petrology/egag012</prism:doi><description>Abstract Oxygen fugacity (ƒO₂) of mantle is a fundamental parameter governing mantle melting, magmatic evolution, and volatile behavior, playing a critical role in material recycling, climate change, and mineralization.

A total of 32 intermediates and end-products are synthesized from CO2, encompassing five universal metabolic precursors. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that molybdenum sulfide containing Mo3+ with vacancy-induced distorted octahedral structure promotes the formation of radicals and enhances their adsorption and coupling in aqueous solutions, leading to CO2 conversion rate of 68.6% and selectivity of up to 70% for C2+ carboxylates. The metal sulfide-catalyzed multiple CO2 reaction networks under extreme conditions could function as a prebiotic precursor to ancient and core metabolic pathways. While nonenzymatic organic synthesis from the H₂–CO₂ redox couple underpins prebiotic carbon metabolism, building integrated, multi-pathway carbon reaction networks prior to enzymatic catalysis remains challenging. Here, the authors show that metallic molybdenum sulfide, mimicking Mo–S₂–pterin enzymes, enables hydrothermal CO₂ reaction networks spanning five carbon sequestration pathways.

While the organic geochemical continuum and evolutionary transitions remain elusive, due to the intense hydrothermal alteration. We apply a metabolomics-inspired molecular fingerprinting strategy integrating mass spectral networking and hierarchical organization, to construct a molecular relatedness phylogenetic tree for vents from ultraslow-spreading Indian Ridge. Here we show that organic molecules from different vent fields and activity states share common molecular connection patterns. The observed progressive molecular evolution from alkanes through aromatics to complex heteroatom-bearing compounds reveals a systematic increase in molecular functionalization and polarity. This finding helps bridge the gap between simple reduced carbon and prebiotic molecular complexity, underscoring the role of hydrothermal systems in shaping life’s essential feedstock on the primordial Earth. This framework may contribute to the search for life-markers on other astrobiological contexts, e.g., Mars, Enceladus, Callisto and Europa.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Abyssal hydrothermal vents are regarded as reactors for simple reduced carbon transforming into more complex forms of prebiotic organic chemistry. While the organic geochemical continuum and evolutionary transitions remain elusive, due to the intense hydrothermal alteration. We apply a metabolomics-inspired molecular fingerprinting strategy integrating mass spectral networking and hierarchical organization, to construct a molecular relatedness phylogenetic tree for vents from ultraslow-spreading Indian Ridge. Here we show that organic molecules from different vent fields and activity states share common molecular connection patterns. The observed progressive molecular evolution from alkanes through aromatics to complex heteroatom-bearing compounds reveals a systematic increase in molecular functionalization and polarity. This finding helps bridge the gap between simple reduced carbon and prebiotic molecular complexity, underscoring the role of hydrothermal systems in shaping life’s essential feedstock on the primordial Earth. This framework may contribute to the search for life-markers on other astrobiological contexts, e.g., Mars, Enceladus, Callisto and Europa.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Reply to the Discussion on “Granite-pegmatite-related gold skarns and associated Li-Cs-Ta pegmatites in the Archean Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia” by Witt (2025)</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00126-025-01426-z</link><guid>10.1007/s00126-025-01426-z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:16:40 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andreas G.

The rocks comprise massive and foliated serpentinites dominated by intergrown lizardite and antigorite with relict Cr-spinel and altered olivine. The JMM serpentinites are characterized by high MgO (34.9–39.2 wt.%), extremely low Al 2 O 3 (0.21–0.92 wt.%) and TiO 2 (0.01–0.03 wt.%), elevated Ni (up to 2462 ppm) and Cr (up to 3143 ppm), and very low high-field-strength element (HFSE) and Th–U contents.

PGE systematics (ΣPGE ≈ 8–26 ppb; modest Pt–Pd enrichment over Os–Ir–Ru; low Pd/Ir=1.18-1.61) record moderate partial melting followed by selective mobilization of PPGEs during serpentinization, preserving a dominantly magmatic signature with a limited metasomatic overprint. We propose the JMM serpentinites originated as a highly depleted mantle residue during intra-oceanic subduction initiation. It was subsequently serpentinized by slab-derived fluids under fore-arc conditions before being tectonically emplaced onto the Arabian margin during Late Cretaceous ophiolite obduction. Relative to the main Semail mantle section, the JMM captures an earlier, less-evolved snapshot of fore-arc development during Late Cretaceous obduction, refining models for Neo-Tethyan subduction initiation and ophiolite assembly.

However, the processes occurring from melt formation to evolution following crustal anatexis, as well as their contributions to magma compositions, remain unclear. This study characterizes the chemical composition and B isotope systematics of tourmaline and muscovite, along with whole-rock geochemistry in high-silica granitic rocks from the central Himalaya. We use these data to constrain the melt formation and subsequent fluid-magma interactions in high-silica granites. The leucosomes exhibit high CaO, Sr, Sr/Y, and Eu/Eu* values but low Rb and Rb/Sr contents, characteristic of hydration melting. Muscovite in the leucosomes shows a significant B isotope range (δ 11 B = −20.6‰ to −5.8‰), with δ 11 B values displaying negative correlations with B, Rb, and Cs contents, and positive correlations with Rb/Cs ratios. These patterns reflect increasing muscovite breakdown during prograde hydration melting. The leucogranites were classified into two groups, including tourmaline and two-mica leucogranites. Compared to the two-mica leucogranites, the tourmaline leucogranites are characterized by higher Rb, Rb/Sr, but lower CaO, Sr/Y, Eu/Eu*, and muscovite δ 11 B values. These geochemical differences primarily reflect distinct melting reactions: tourmaline leucogranites result from muscovite dehydration melting, whereas two-mica leucogranites form through hydration melting. In tourmaline leucogranites, tourmaline exhibits δ 11 B ranging from −18.2‰ to −13.5‰, with increasing δ 11 B values and Nb, Ta, and rare earth element (REE) contents from core to rim, indicative of fluid-magma interactions. Magmatic fluid metasomatism also explains the muscovite B isotopic zoning from both leucogranite types, with rims showing elevated δ 11 B, Rb, Cs, and B values alongside notably decreased Nb/Ta ratios. Geochemical modeling suggests that fluid–magma interaction with fluid/magma ratios of 0.2–0.6 could produce the observed B isotopic zoning. Therefore, in-situ tourmaline and muscovite B systematic studies reveal the role of magmatic fluids in the generation of the Himalayan leucogranites. Furthermore, the leucogranites exhibit higher whole-rock and muscovite rare-metal (Li, Nb, Ta, Rb, and Cs) contents than the leucosomes. The rare metals increased, accompanied by the sharply decreased Nb/Ta ratios in the muscovite rims. This evidence supports that the magmatic fluid metasomatism represents a key mechanism for elevating rare metal contents in high-silica granites.

Here, we establish a microbial platform using the acid-tolerant yeast Issatchenkia orientalis SD108 to produce bio-oxalic acid for REE recovery. By introducing an oxaloacetate cleavage pathway and applying metabolic engineering, the engineered strain produces 39.53 g·L-1 oxalic acid at pH 4.0 in fed-batch fermentation. The crude fermentation broth, used without purification, efficiently precipitates over 99% neodymium (Nd), 99% dysprosium (Dy), and 98% lanthanum (La) from individual REE chloride solutions. Recovery from a low-grade ore leachate achieves over 99% total recovery. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirm that REE oxalates precipitated with bio-oxalic acid closely resemble those obtained using commercial oxalic acid. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) further demonstrate that bio-oxalic acid can be produced at a competitive price of $1.79·kg-1 while reducing carbon intensity (CI) by 112% to 63.5% with and without electricity displacement, respectively, relative to the fossil-based benchmark. These results highlight bio-oxalic acid as a green, economically viable alternative to synthetic oxalate for sustainable REE recovery. The growing demand for rare earth elements (REEs) underscores the need for sustainable recovery methods and a reliable supply. Here the authors establish a platform using a yeast to produce bio-oxalic acid for REE recovery, achieving 99% REE recovery from low-grade ore.

Here, we establish a microbial platform using the acid-tolerant yeast Issatchenkia orientalis SD108 to produce bio-oxalic acid for REE recovery. By introducing an oxaloacetate cleavage pathway and applying metabolic engineering, the engineered strain produces 39.53 g·L-1 oxalic acid at pH 4.0 in fed-batch fermentation. The crude fermentation broth, used without purification, efficiently precipitates over 99% neodymium (Nd), 99% dysprosium (Dy), and 98% lanthanum (La) from individual REE chloride solutions. Recovery from a low-grade ore leachate achieves over 99% total recovery. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirm that REE oxalates precipitated with bio-oxalic acid closely resemble those obtained using commercial oxalic acid. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) further demonstrate that bio-oxalic acid can be produced at a competitive price of $1.79·kg-1 while reducing carbon intensity (CI) by 112% to 63.5% with and without electricity displacement, respectively, relative to the fossil-based benchmark. These results highlight bio-oxalic acid as a green, economically viable alternative to synthetic oxalate for sustainable REE recovery. The growing demand for rare earth elements (REEs) underscores the need for sustainable recovery methods and a reliable supply. Here the authors establish a platform using a yeast to produce bio-oxalic acid for REE recovery, achieving 99% REE recovery from low-grade ore.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Province-scale tin and zinc stable isotope fractionation trends in the Bolivian tin belt</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2026.01.048</link><guid>10.1016/j.gca.2026.01.048</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 16:25:49 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Evan C.
