This structure is similar to that proposed for the mafic magma system feeding the 1650 CE rhyolites, suggesting a steady state for the deep plumbing system throughout the history of Kolumbo. The mafic inputs increased with time, arriving at shallow levels during the 1650 CE eruption, and likely continuing in the current state of Kolumbo, as indicated by geophysical data.

We generate tunable PNCs in glass via nanophase separation and ion exchange in the perovskite domains. PNCs-in-glass hierarchical structures are created by controlling nanophase separation and crystallization of PNCs. Substantially increased scattering in the hierarchical structures enables stable CW single-mode random lasing with an ultralow threshold of 52.6 milliwatts per square centimeter. We achieve flexible CW random lasers by incorporating hierarchical structures into the polydimethylsiloxane film. The random lasers are used in speckle-free laser imaging and dynamic holographic displays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Publisher Correction: Tree methane exchange in a changing world</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-026-00762-6</link><guid>10.1038/s43017-026-00762-6</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:10:23 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Vincent Gauci</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Reviews Earth &amp;amp; Environment</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s43017-026-00762-6</prism:doi><description>Correction to: Nature Reviews Earth &amp; Environment https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-025-00692-9 , published online 19 June 2025.

These performances match the state-of-the-art among all reported single-component, near-infrared-responsive photocatalysts. This work highlights the potential of coordination-driven assembly of highly stable lead halide frameworks for near-infrared-driven artificial photosynthesis. A family of bis(terpyridine)-metal-functionalized lead halide frameworks is synthesized with both near-infrared absorption and charge-polarized sites, demonstrating efficient near-infrared-driven CO2 photoreduction to C2 hydrocarbon products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Origin and evolution of the most Mars-like yardang landforms in the Qaidam Basin of Northwest China</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-026-03202-x</link><guid>10.1038/s43247-026-03202-x</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:53:19 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jimin Sun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tongyan Lü</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kefa Zhou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ran Zhang</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Communications Earth &amp;amp; Environment</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s43247-026-03202-x</prism:doi><description>The inland basins of western China are home to the world’s earliest definition of yardangs, which are streamlined, wind-sculpted landforms.

Yardang development in the Qaidam Basin of China commenced around 0.8 million years ago, starting in the northwest and gradually expanding southeast, correlating with significant growth of the Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet, according to electron spin resonance and optically stimulated luminescence dating analysis.
