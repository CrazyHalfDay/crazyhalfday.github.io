Textural, chemical, and isotopic characteristics of hydrothermal pyrite and apatite from gold veins provide crucial constraints on fluid compositions, which can potentially reflect episodic variations in source reservoirs and/or changes in fluid physicochemical conditions. This study presents detailed textural observations, in-situ trace element analyses, and S-Pb isotopic data for multiple texturally distinct pyrite generations from the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou structurally controlled gold deposit in the Tongbai Orogen. Integrated with hydrothermal apatite U-Pb ages and Sr isotopic compositions, these results offer new constraints on the deposit’s fluid source, evolutionary history, and genetic mechanism. Two primary types of gold mineralization are identified: (1) altered rock-type ores (predominantly disseminated and veinlet-style) dominated by invisible gold-bearing arsenian pyrite (particularly Py2c and Py3) and minor base metal sulfides, accompanied by intense wall-rock alteration (muscovitization, sulfidation, carbonatization, silicification); and (2) vein-type ores (quartz veins), characterized by visible gold, As- and Au-poor pyrite (Py4 and Py5), and abundant base metal sulfides, with limited alteration halos dominated by muscovite and quartz. Five mineralization stages (I–V) are distinguished, corresponding to seven texturally and temporally distinct pyrite generations: Py1 (Stage I), Py2a–Py2c (Stage II), Py3 (Stage III), Py4 (Stage IV), and Py5 (Stage V). LA-ICP-MS trace element analyses reveal systematic compositional differences between pyrites from the two ore types: altered rock-type pyrites (Py1–Py3) are enriched in Au (median 15 ppm in Py1, 195 ppm in Py3), As (median 2872 ppm in Py1, 26868 ppm in Py2b), Co (median 90 ppm in Py1, 177 ppm in Py3), and Ni (median 80 ppm in Py1, 75 ppm in Py3). Stage II Py2 exhibits a core-mantle-rim zoning, with an Au- and As-poor Py2a core, a porous and inclusion-rich Au-As-enriched Py2b mantle, and an oscillatory-zoned Au-As-rich Py2c rim). In contrast, vein-type pyrites (Py4–Py5) are severely depleted in Au (median 0.01 ppm in Py4, 0.03 ppm in Py5) and As (median 3.1 ppm in Py4, 1.1 ppm in Py5), with significantly lower concentrations of other trace metals (e.g., Co ≤ 32 ppm, Ni ≤ 95 ppm). Oscillatory zoning of lattice-bound As and Au in altered rock-type pyrites (Py2b and Py3) is attributed to cyclic fluid immiscibility and vapor condensation driven by pressure fluctuations. Subsequent fluid immiscibility and cooling promoted the co-precipitation of visible gold and base metal sulfides in vein-type ores. Sulfur isotope compositions (δ3⁴S) of sulfides from Stages I–III altered rock-type ores range from −1.7‰ to 9.5‰, indicating a mixed sulfur source involving magmatic and host-rock components. In Stages IV–V vein-type ores, sulfides and baryte display δ3⁴S values of −3.9‰ to 5.6‰ and 8.2‰ to 14.5‰, respectively; texturally equilibrated pyrite and baryte yield a calculated total sulfur δ3⁴S value of 4.9‰, consistent with a predominantly magmatic sulfur source. Pyrite and galena exhibit consistent in-situ Pb isotope compositions across all mineralization stages, pointing to a common lead source. Vein-hosted calcite (Stages IV–V) and scheelite (Stage V) display ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios of 0.7089–0.7102, indicative of magmatic Sr. In contrast, altered rock-type ankerite (Stages II–III) and apatite (Stage II) show more radiogenic Sr isotopic compositions (0.7115–0.7142), suggesting intense fluid-rock interaction. Hydrothermal apatite intergrown with Stage II pyrite yields a U-Pb age of 133.2 ± 5.0 Ma, consistent with the previously reported Rb-Sr isochron age (132.6 ± 2.7 Ma) for vein-type ores and the emplacement age of adjacent Qijianfeng granite (140–130 Ma). Collectively, field observations, textural analyses, geochronological data, compositional studies, and S-Pb-Sr isotopic results demonstrate that the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou gold mineralization was derived from a single Early Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal fluid system. Spatial and temporal variations in fluid physicochemical parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity) and fluid-rock interactions account for the observed mineralogical diversity within this structurally controlled gold system.

Hydrothermal apatite intergrown with Stage II pyrite yields a U-Pb age of 133.2 ± 5.0 Ma, consistent with the previously reported Rb-Sr isochron age (132.6 ± 2.7 Ma) for vein-type ores and the emplacement age of adjacent Qijianfeng granite (140–130 Ma). Collectively, field observations, textural analyses, geochronological data, compositional studies, and S-Pb-Sr isotopic results demonstrate that the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou gold mineralization was derived from a single Early Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal fluid system. Spatial and temporal variations in fluid physicochemical parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity) and fluid-rock interactions account for the observed mineralogical diversity within this structurally controlled gold system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Diamond evidence for limited subduction of phosphorus into the lower mantle</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1130/g54011.1</link><guid>10.1130/g54011.1</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 20:45:25 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Qiwei Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Frank E.

Applying this calibration to magmatic olivine from 22 kimberlites yields reconstructed Na2Omelt of 1.9−8.6 wt% (typically ±0.25 wt%) at 1 GPa, showing that magmatic Na contents are much higher than indicated by bulk rock measurements. The lower range of these reconstructed Na2O values aligns with the predicted 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% of asthenospheric carbonated silicate melts generated from typical lherzolitic mantle at 7 GPa. The higher values correspond to the same 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% if recalculated for olivine crystallization at 2−4 GPa. Because Na2O loss through fluid exsolution during kimberlite ascent cannot exceed 0.5 wt%, the extreme Na loss leading to the observed low bulk-kimberlite values must occur upon solidification when copious amounts of Na-rich fluids are expelled. These findings suggest that kimberlitic melts do not require a peculiar mantle source, but rather carbon-bearing fertile lherzolites that melt at adiabatic conditions, placing kimberlites into a broad continuum with primitive alkaline ocean island melts.

This study further highlights the striking parallels between the CAOB and the present-day Southwest Pacific as archipelagic accretionary orogenic systems, offering valuable insights for comparative tectonic studies and advancing our understanding of orogenic belt evolution.

This study further highlights the striking parallels between the CAOB and the present-day Southwest Pacific as archipelagic accretionary orogenic systems, offering valuable insights for comparative tectonic studies and advancing our understanding of orogenic belt evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Temperature Controls on Carbon‐Sulfur Diagenesis in Deep Hydrothermal Subseafloor Sediments</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025gl119353</link><guid>10.1029/2025gl119353</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:03:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Bing‐Zheng Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jiarui Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guang‐Chao Zhuang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiting Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhen Zhou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Andreas P.

Clinopyroxene (Cpx) serves as an ideal archive for deciphering crustal assimilation in such magmatic systems, as it crystallizes over a wide range of melt compositions and is relatively rich in elements that can be used as isotopic tracers (such as Sr). Here, we conduct detailed petrographic studies and in-situ elemental and Sr isotopic analyses along core-to-rim traverses of Cpx from a suite of coeval potassic–ultrapotassic mafic lavas and dikes sampled at six locations of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Two populations of Cpx are identified: phenocrysts and green cores interpreted as recycled crystals from differentiated progenitor magmas related to the host magmas. The phenocryst cores are characterized by high Mg# (up to 90) and elevated Ni and Cr contents, consistent with derivation from primitive mantle-derived melts. Their similarly high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, combined with trace-element systematics, suggest that the primitive melts were derived from a common, slightly enriched lithospheric mantle source metasomatized by carbonate melt-dominated agents. Cpx-based thermobarometry indicates that these magmas ascended through the crust and crystallized at depths corresponding to ~0.2–1.0 GPa, defining a transcrustal plumbing system. Normal core-to-rim zoning in Cpx phenocrysts, as shown by decreasing Mg# and Ni and Cr contents, and increasing incompatible element concentrations (e.g. rare earth elements and Zr), reflects fractional crystallization of Cpx, olivine, and/or phlogopite in the magma plumbing system. Concurrently, systematic increases in initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios from core to rim (up to 0.004) record progressive assimilation of crustal materials with high Sr isotopic ratios. The presence of Neoproterozoic zircon xenocrysts, along with Sr content and isotopic data from regional crustal rocks, identifies Neoproterozoic granitic gneiss as the most likely assimilant. Quantitative models support this interpretation and indicate assimilated wall-rock melt masses of &amp;lt;0.2. Our in-situ micro-analytical data demonstrate that even crustal assimilation to this limited extent can markedly control the isotopic signature of potassic–ultrapotassic mafic magmas in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Given that such magmas significantly contribute to crustal growth by differentiating into voluminous granitoids, this study provides critical insights into how assimilation modulates the isotopic composition of the post-collisional newly-formed crust.

The potential for metallogenesis in narrow asymmetric rifts decreases with increasing proximity to the craton edge. In contrast, metal source rock area and ore-forming mechanisms increase when wide rifts form close to a craton edge. We attribute these responses to the increased lithospheric strength on the craton-ward side of the rift that determines not only the initial fault geometry, but also the subsequent fault development and migration direction. This modifies the spatial and temporal overlap of the components of the mineral system required for deposit formation, i.e., source rock, fluid-focussing faults, and deposit host rock. The greatest metallogenic potential is found in the narrow margin of narrow asymmetric rifts formed far from a craton edge; here, the largest area of source rock is concentrated in the main border basin. The link between craton edges and metallogenic potential, therefore, is hypothesized to be due to the preferred initialization of rifts next to, and the preferential preservation of deposits on, the edges of stable cratons.

This modifies the spatial and temporal overlap of the components of the mineral system required for deposit formation, i.e., source rock, fluid-focussing faults, and deposit host rock. The greatest metallogenic potential is found in the narrow margin of narrow asymmetric rifts formed far from a craton edge; here, the largest area of source rock is concentrated in the main border basin. The link between craton edges and metallogenic potential, therefore, is hypothesized to be due to the preferred initialization of rifts next to, and the preferential preservation of deposits on, the edges of stable cratons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Growth and physical transport of molybdenite spherules in a Na-Al-F-rich melt, Cave Peak porphyry Mo deposit, Texas, USA</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1130/g53827.1</link><guid>10.1130/g53827.1</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 20:35:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>J.

This study systematically investigated Nb 2 O 5 solubility and Nb speciation in 0.1 to 4.5 mol/kg HF solutions at temperatures of 150–350 °C under vapor-saturated pressures. Experimental results reveal that Nb 2 O 5 solubility increases significantly with rising HF concentration from 0.1 to 2.0 mol/kg, reaching up to ~10,000 ppm dissolved Nb. Beyond 2.0 mol/kg, however, the dissolved Nb concentration does not rise persistently, but fluctuates around a mean value of 15,200 ± 6300 ppm. This trend most likely results from decreased HF dissociation and enhanced solvation effects at elevated temperatures and pressures.

The formation constants (log K ) for this species vary from −5.47 ± 0.56 at 150 °C to −7.61 ± 0.20 at 350 °C.

The recognition of intermittent plasticity in geological materials provides additional constraints on models of dislocation-mediated flow and raises questions about the mechanisms of transient instabilities in otherwise ductile regimes, such as deep earthquakes and slow-slip events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Was the mantle warmer when Pangea broke up? insights from initial oceanic crustal thickness alongside the rifted margins of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2026.119897</link><guid>10.1016/j.epsl.2026.119897</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 20:00:53 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Daniel Sauter</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gianreto Manatschal</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nick Kusznir</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nicolas Coltice</dc:creator><dc:creator>Pauline Chenin</dc:creator><dc:creator>Marc Ulrich</dc:creator><dc:creator>Marie Garbaciak</dc:creator><dc:creator>Philippe Werner</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1016/j.epsl.2026.119897</prism:doi><description>Insulation by the Pangean supercontinent has been suggested to have resulted in subcontinental mantle thermal anomalies and enhanced magmatic activity that may have influenced continental breakup.

Our findings indicate that the δ 98 Mo signal generated by adsorption at the sediment‐water interface is not preserved during burial, suggesting that the canonical −0.7‰ value of the oxic sink requires re‐evaluation. In the lower section of the South Pacific Site, we also identify two positive excursions reaching δ 98 Mo auth values as high as +1.7‰. This portion of the site was influenced by near‐field hydrothermal processes, and we propose that these large excursions reflect Mo adsorption onto Fe (oxyhydr)oxides.

We investigated lithology, mineralogy, and chemistry of the host sedimentary rocks (Late Triassic Isatomae Formation) in the Ishinomaki district to evaluate gold mineralizing potential in the belt. The formation consists of shallow‐marine continental shelf sedimentary rocks that underwent prehnite‐pumpellyite facies of contact metamorphism. The analyzed three representative slate samples of the formation contain diagenetic‐metamorphic minerals such as calcite, K‐feldspar, albite, pumpellyite, titanite, and apatite, in addition to micro‐nodules and seams consisting of carbonaceous matter (CM) and/or sulfides. The carbonaceous matter in the nodules and seams was partly or mostly substituted by sulfides; pyrite with minor cobaltite and pyrrhotite, which occur as framboids, compact spheres, and compact anhedral grains. Cobaltite contains rarely electrum grains. These samples are characterized by high Ca contents, and are depleted in Mg, Fe, Na, and K, compared to the underlying Paleozoic and Mesozoic shale and overlying Jurassic sedimentary rocks of the belt. A sulfide nodule‐bearing sample is enriched in metals such as As, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sb. Depletion of sulfur mole ratio of the pyrites, in particular, framboidal/spherical pyrite, compared to the stoichiometric ratio, suggests that the pyrites formed from monosulfides. Most of the trace elements such as As, Bi, Pb, Tl, Sb, and Mo are more enriched in pyrite than pyrrhotite. These analytical results of the Isatomae Formation indicate that this slate was accumulated in an anoxic seawater environment and enriched in metallic elements, which may have been adsorbed to Fe‐oxyhydroxide particles originally. The successive diagenetic reaction with pore water sulfurized the Fe‐oxyhydroxides to monosulfides, which finally transformed into pyrite. The narrow and enriched range (+0.3‰ to +0.5‰) δ 34 S values of sulfides in the Isatomae slate suggest that this diagenetic reaction occurred in a closed system, where seawater sulfate hardly diffused into the sediments. Subsequent prehnite‐pumpellyite metamorphism transformed pyrite to pyrrhotite, during which metamorphism, the trace elements including Au may have exsolved into metamorphic fluids. These results show a gold mineralizing potential for the Isatomae Formation.

A sulfide nodule‐bearing sample is enriched in metals such as As, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sb. Depletion of sulfur mole ratio of the pyrites, in particular, framboidal/spherical pyrite, compared to the stoichiometric ratio, suggests that the pyrites formed from monosulfides. Most of the trace elements such as As, Bi, Pb, Tl, Sb, and Mo are more enriched in pyrite than pyrrhotite. These analytical results of the Isatomae Formation indicate that this slate was accumulated in an anoxic seawater environment and enriched in metallic elements, which may have been adsorbed to Fe‐oxyhydroxide particles originally. The successive diagenetic reaction with pore water sulfurized the Fe‐oxyhydroxides to monosulfides, which finally transformed into pyrite. The narrow and enriched range (+0.3‰ to +0.5‰) δ 34 S values of sulfides in the Isatomae slate suggest that this diagenetic reaction occurred in a closed system, where seawater sulfate hardly diffused into the sediments. Subsequent prehnite‐pumpellyite metamorphism transformed pyrite to pyrrhotite, during which metamorphism, the trace elements including Au may have exsolved into metamorphic fluids. These results show a gold mineralizing potential for the Isatomae Formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
