The THg (total Hg) content in sulfides and chlorite decreases with increasing distance from the mineralization center, reflecting the variable influence of magmatic volatiles released from the underlying magmatic system, while fluid boiling likely leads to significant variations in δ 202 Hg (exceeding 2‰). The elevated Fe 3+ /∑Fe values, distinct Hg and Sn enrichments, and high formation temperatures (above 400 °C) recorded by Hg-rich chlorite suggest that acidic, hot, oxidized, metal-rich volatiles facilitate the transport of Cu and S from the magmatic to the hydrothermal environment, promoting the formation of large VMS deposits. We propose that the Early Devonian extensional setting enabled oxidized magmatism and volatiles, facilitating efficient Cu and S transport, during which the metal-rich magmatic-hydrothermal fluids (Δ 199 Hg ≈ 0) mixed with seawater (Δ 199 Hg &gt; 0) and continental sediments (Δ 199 Hg 199 Hg range.

This study presents an integrated petrological, geochemical, geochronological, and phase equilibrium investigation of garnet-bearing granite from the Chengde area of the Trans-North China Orogen. The garnet exhibits homogeneous major element compositions but distinct trace element zoning patterns, characterized by a decrease in yttrium and heavy rare earth element concentrations from core to rim, which is indicative of growth zoning. Textural evidence of garnet-quartz intergrowth, coupled with trace element variations, documents a multistage growth history involving initial metamorphic nucleation followed by rim development under suprasolidus conditions. Phase equilibrium modeling constrains the garnet formation conditions to 10.7−11.1 kbar and 760−775 °C, similar to thermometric estimates of 685−757 °C. Comprehensive datasets, including whole-rock geochemistry, zircon trace elements, and garnet geochemistry, collectively indicate an S-type granite origin from clay-poor metapelitic sources. Magmatic emplacement occurred at 1886−1875 Ma, followed by metamorphic overprinting at 1855−1802 Ma. These findings highlight the utility of garnet as a robust petrogenetic indicator, providing key insights into peritectic phase entrainment during crustal anatexis. The results significantly advance our understanding of granite formation mechanisms in collisional orogens and elucidate the processes of lower-crustal reworking during Paleoproterozoic orogenesis.

&lt;p&gt;Garnet serves as a key mineral in some granitic rocks, offering unique constraints on melt generation and crustal evolution processes. This study presents an integrated petrological, geochemical, geochronological, and phase equilibrium investigation of garnet-bearing granite from the Chengde area of the Trans-North China Orogen.

Applying this calibration to magmatic olivine from 22 kimberlites yields reconstructed Na2Omelt of 1.9−8.6 wt% (typically ±0.25 wt%) at 1 GPa, showing that magmatic Na contents are much higher than indicated by bulk rock measurements. The lower range of these reconstructed Na2O values aligns with the predicted 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% of asthenospheric carbonated silicate melts generated from typical lherzolitic mantle at 7 GPa. The higher values correspond to the same 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% if recalculated for olivine crystallization at 2−4 GPa. Because Na2O loss through fluid exsolution during kimberlite ascent cannot exceed 0.5 wt%, the extreme Na loss leading to the observed low bulk-kimberlite values must occur upon solidification when copious amounts of Na-rich fluids are expelled.

&lt;p&gt;The large-scale Shanmen silver deposit (Shanmen Ag deposit) is situated in the Siping area of Jilin Province, northeastern China (NE China). To better understand the formation of the Shanmen deposit, we present S–Pb–He–Ar isotope systematics, zircon U–Pb dating, molybdenite Re–Os geochronology, sulfide Rb–Sr isochron analysis, and in situ sericite Rb–Sr dating hydrothermally altered minerals. Our in-situ sulfur isotope analyses reveal a restricted δ 34 S variation range from −1.9 ‰ to +0.8 ‰ (average = -0.4 ‰) for hydrothermal sulfides, suggests a magmatic sulfur source. In situ lead isotope analyses of galena exhibit remarkably homogeneous compositions with limited variation ranges: 206 Pb/ 204 Pb of 18.148–18.154, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb of 15.542–15.547 and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb of 38.067–38.083.

Although these magmas are typically modified by crustal assimilation during ascent, key aspects of this process, especially the type and amount of assimilated material and the consequent effects on magma composition, remain poorly constrained, hindering a full understanding of their petrogenesis. Clinopyroxene (Cpx) serves as an ideal archive for deciphering crustal assimilation in such magmatic systems, as it crystallizes over a wide range of melt compositions and is relatively rich in elements that can be used as isotopic tracers (such as Sr). Here, we conduct detailed petrographic studies and in-situ elemental and Sr isotopic analyses along core-to-rim traverses of Cpx from a suite of coeval potassic–ultrapotassic mafic lavas and dikes sampled at six locations of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Two populations of Cpx are identified: phenocrysts and green cores interpreted as recycled crystals from differentiated progenitor magmas related to the host magmas. The phenocryst cores are characterized by high Mg# (up to 90) and elevated Ni and Cr contents, consistent with derivation from primitive mantle-derived melts. Their similarly high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, combined with trace-element systematics, suggest that the primitive melts were derived from a common, slightly enriched lithospheric mantle source metasomatized by carbonate melt-dominated agents. Cpx-based thermobarometry indicates that these magmas ascended through the crust and crystallized at depths corresponding to ~0.2–1.0 GPa, defining a transcrustal plumbing system. Normal core-to-rim zoning in Cpx phenocrysts, as shown by decreasing Mg# and Ni and Cr contents, and increasing incompatible element concentrations (e.g. rare earth elements and Zr), reflects fractional crystallization of Cpx, olivine, and/or phlogopite in the magma plumbing system. Concurrently, systematic increases in initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios from core to rim (up to 0.004) record progressive assimilation of crustal materials with high Sr isotopic ratios.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Potassic–ultrapotassic magmas in continental collision zones have attracted much attention due to their genetic association with magmatic–hydrothermal Cu–Au ore formation and lithospheric mantle evolution. Although these magmas are typically modified by crustal assimilation during ascent, key aspects of this process, especially the type and amount of assimilated material and the consequent effects on magma composition, remain poorly constrained, hindering a full understanding of their petrogenesis. Clinopyroxene (Cpx) serves as an ideal archive for deciphering crustal assimilation in such magmatic systems, as it crystallizes over a wide range of melt compositions and is relatively rich in elements that can be used as isotopic tracers (such as Sr). Here, we conduct detailed petrographic studies and in-situ elemental and Sr isotopic analyses along core-to-rim traverses of Cpx from a suite of coeval potassic–ultrapotassic mafic lavas and dikes sampled at six locations of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Two populations of Cpx are identified: phenocrysts and green cores interpreted as recycled crystals from differentiated progenitor magmas related to the host magmas. The phenocryst cores are characterized by high Mg# (up to 90) and elevated Ni and Cr contents, consistent with derivation from primitive mantle-derived melts. Their similarly high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, combined with trace-element systematics, suggest that the primitive melts were derived from a common, slightly enriched lithospheric mantle source metasomatized by carbonate melt-dominated agents. Cpx-based thermobarometry indicates that these magmas ascended through the crust and crystallized at depths corresponding to ~0.2–1.0 GPa, defining a transcrustal plumbing system. Normal core-to-rim zoning in Cpx phenocrysts, as shown by decreasing Mg# and Ni and Cr contents, and increasing incompatible element concentrations (e.g. rare earth elements and Zr), reflects fractional crystallization of Cpx, olivine, and/or phlogopite in the magma plumbing system. Concurrently, systematic increases in initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios from core to rim (up to 0.004) record progressive assimilation of crustal materials with high Sr isotopic ratios. The presence of Neoproterozoic zircon xenocrysts, along with Sr content and isotopic data from regional crustal rocks, identifies Neoproterozoic granitic gneiss as the most likely assimilant. Quantitative models support this interpretation and indicate assimilated wall-rock melt masses of &amp;amp;lt;0.2. Our in-situ micro-analytical data demonstrate that even crustal assimilation to this limited extent can markedly control the isotopic signature of potassic–ultrapotassic mafic magmas in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau.

The lowest ratios, or most negative μ 182 W values when calculated as parts per million variations from an assumed Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) value, correspond with elevated 3 He/ 4 He compositions for some OIB lavas. Possible explanations for these anomalous isotopic compositions include: 1) core-mantle interaction following initial core-mantle separation or 2) early differentiation of the silicate mantle. Elevated 3 He/ 4 He in OIB originates from a less-degassed portion of the mantle, compared to the accessible upper mantle, and has been associated with a moderately depleted mantle component with long-lived radiogenic isotope characteristics intermediate to all known extreme mantle endmembers. This component has commonly been referred to as the “FOcal ZOne” or FOZO. In addition to these characteristics, FOZO has been suggested to have anomalous enrichments in the high field strength elements (HFSE) Ti, Ta, and Nb. Tungsten is a moderately siderophile element that behaves as an HFSE in the silicate Earth, and in some OIB, μ 182 W and Ti, Ta, and Nb enrichments display negative correlations. To further investigate the relation between anomalous μ 182 W, 3 He/ 4 He and Ti, Ta, and Nb enrichments in melts most closely associated with the FOZO mantle source, we analyzed basalts from three intraplate volcanic tracks, Easter-Salas y Gomez, Bowie-Kodiak, and Louisville, for μ 182 W and bulk major and trace elements. The new isotopic data for each hotspot system record μ 182 W values that are within the global range of OIB (Easter-Salas y Gomez μ 182 W = +3 to −17; Bowie-Kodiak μ 182 W = +1 to −12; and Louisville μ 182 W = −1 to −9). To test whether these compositions can be explained by the crystallization of an early basal magma ocean and subsequent long-term isolation of its crystallization products, a simple fractional crystallization model was developed. We find that nearly all isotopic and trace element compositions inferred for the FOZO component can be reproduced by the chemical fractionations produced with this model. Furthermore, the model is consistent with data for additional OIB sampled globally. Finally, our model results also indicate that the Sm/Nd ratio in the inferred FOZO reservoir may not be sufficiently modified by bridgmanite fractionation to generate resolvable μ 142 Nd anomalies in OIB (resulting from decay in the 146 Sm- 142 Nd short-lived system) relative to BSE. This is consistent with the lack of μ 142 Nd anomalies in most OIB, even where negative μ 182 W anomalies are largest. Collectively, these findings indicate that at least some of the anomalous 182 W/ 184 W compositions observed in modern OIB may plausibly originate from a differentiation product of the silicate mantle that formed within the first 60 Ma of Solar System history, and without the need for core-mantle interaction.

In these mush-dominated systems, it is likely that melt-mush reactions between migrating melts and the pre-existing mush influence the chemical evolution of magmas. However, melt-mush reactions and their effect on the chemical evolution of arc magmas can be elusive and cannot be constrained when studying erupted lavas in isolation. In this study, we focus on the island of St. Vincent in the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc because (1) the composition of erupted lavas has been interpreted to reflect simple fractional crystallisation, with minimal influence of other magmatic processes, and (2) an abundance of plutonic xenoliths (erupted fragments of crystal mush) can be found within the eruptive products. Thus, we are able to compare interpretations gleaned from the chemistry of erupted lavas with new observations of the crystal mush in the same magmatic system. To this end, textural analyses were undertaken on seventeen representative plutonic xenoliths from St Vincent, and four of these samples (two olivine gabbros, two hornblende-olivine gabbros) were studied in detail via element mapping, mineral trace element analyses and geochemical modelling. The chemical, textural and mineralogical characteristics of the olivine gabbros were best explained via fractional crystallisation in the mid-upper crust (~6–18 km depth). However, the hornblende-olivine gabbros (two of seventeen samples studied) contained clear textural evidence for melt-mush reaction in the mid-upper crust. The trace element compositions of minerals such as clinopyroxene in these two samples were best reproduced via assimilation-fractional crystallisation modelling, simulating melt-mush reactions, supporting the textural evidence. Our plutonic xenoliths reveal that in addition to fractional crystallisation, cryptic (i.e. not directly recorded in lavas) melt-mush reaction processes also contribute to magma chemical evolution, particularly influencing trace elements, within the sub-volcanic plumbing system. Textural evidence for melt-mush reaction is increasingly reported in plutonic xenoliths from other active arcs and exhumed arc crustal sections, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous in mush-dominated arc plumbing systems. Melt-mush reaction therefore represents an important process contributing to arc magma and arc crust trace element chemical diversity.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract In subduction zones, it is widely established that magmas are stored as crystal dominated mush within sub-volcanic plumbing systems. In these mush-dominated systems, it is likely that melt-mush reactions between migrating melts and the pre-existing mush influence the chemical evolution of magmas. However, melt-mush reactions and their effect on the chemical evolution of arc magmas can be elusive and cannot be constrained when studying erupted lavas in isolation. In this study, we focus on the island of St. Vincent in the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc because (1) the composition of erupted lavas has been interpreted to reflect simple fractional crystallisation, with minimal influence of other magmatic processes, and (2) an abundance of plutonic xenoliths (erupted fragments of crystal mush) can be found within the eruptive products. Thus, we are able to compare interpretations gleaned from the chemistry of erupted lavas with new observations of the crystal mush in the same magmatic system. To this end, textural analyses were undertaken on seventeen representative plutonic xenoliths from St Vincent, and four of these samples (two olivine gabbros, two hornblende-olivine gabbros) were studied in detail via element mapping, mineral trace element analyses and geochemical modelling. The chemical, textural and mineralogical characteristics of the olivine gabbros were best explained via fractional crystallisation in the mid-upper crust (~6–18 km depth). However, the hornblende-olivine gabbros (two of seventeen samples studied) contained clear textural evidence for melt-mush reaction in the mid-upper crust. The trace element compositions of minerals such as clinopyroxene in these two samples were best reproduced via assimilation-fractional crystallisation modelling, simulating melt-mush reactions, supporting the textural evidence. Our plutonic xenoliths reveal that in addition to fractional crystallisation, cryptic (i.e. not directly recorded in lavas) melt-mush reaction processes also contribute to magma chemical evolution, particularly influencing trace elements, within the sub-volcanic plumbing system. Textural evidence for melt-mush reaction is increasingly reported in plutonic xenoliths from other active arcs and exhumed arc crustal sections, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous in mush-dominated arc plumbing systems.

The results reveal systematic Rb isotope fractionation, with Li-rich pegmatites showing the highest δ⁸⁷Rb values (up to + 0.63‰) and Li contents (up to 6011&amp;nbsp;µg/g), significantly exceeding both wall rocks (-1.24‰ to + 0.29‰) and the average upper continental crust (-0.14‰).

Integration of Rb isotopes with Li and Ba isotopes reveals a coherent magmatic-fluid signature, establishing a novel multi-isotope approach to trace fluid-mediated ore-forming processes. We conclude that δ⁸⁷Rb values primarily reflect fluid flux and interaction intensity, whereas Li concentrations record precipitation efficiency.
