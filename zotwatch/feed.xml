Based on more than 2,700 shell‐derived streamwater δ 18 O values reconstructed from four Northern Swedish catchments we estimated contributions of precipitation to streamflow since 1836. The reconstructed δ 18 O streamwater records, which typically capture summer low‐flow conditions during the growing season of the mussels, showed pronounced differences between catchments. In a monitored reference catchment, a negative correlation between baseflow and δ 18 O‐derived contributions of summer precipitation suggests that these differences reflect catchment‐specific variations in baseflow during low‐flow conditions. These variations in seasonal precipitation contributions to streamflow were linked to physiographic catchment characteristics, which also affected long‐term summer low flow conditions. Reconstructions based on bivalve shells therefore provide insights into how landscape features (e.g., catchment size, soil conductivity, lakes) influence water transit times and delay the release of winter precipitation across catchments over centuries. With this transferable and scalable approach, isotope data sets can be extended into pre‐instrumental times, supporting adaptive water‐resource management in data‐scarce regions.

This is a particularly intriguing issue in members of the genus Sulfolobus which encode homologs of a “bacterial-like” candidate segregation machinery, termed SegAB, related to the bacterial ParA-based systems, yet rely on a “eukaryotic-like” ESCRT machinery for cell division. While investigating the temporal dynamics of Sulfolobus chromosome architecture, we uncovered conformational changes at the candidate segregation locus. Loss of the Seg system results in altered nucleoid morphology and induction of a DNA damage response. Significantly, loss of the Seg system also leads to precocious assembly of the key cell division protein CdvA. Finally, we observe interactions between SegA and CdvA, indicating dual roles for the Seg system in effecting chromosome segregation and defining the positioning of the cell division apparatus. Very little is known about the molecular basis of chromosome segregation in archaea. Here, the authors describe conformational changes in the chromosome during the cell cycle of the archaeon Sulfolobus. The changes depend on candidate chromosome segregation proteins that interact with the cell division machinery.

&lt;p&gt;Despite its fundamental importance for the propagation of all cellular life, very little is known about the molecular basis of chromosome segregation in archaea. This is a particularly intriguing issue in members of the genus Sulfolobus which encode homologs of a “bacterial-like” candidate segregation machinery, termed SegAB, related to the bacterial ParA-based systems, yet rely on a “eukaryotic-like” ESCRT machinery for cell division. While investigating the temporal dynamics of Sulfolobus chromosome architecture, we uncovered conformational changes at the candidate segregation locus. Loss of the Seg system results in altered nucleoid morphology and induction of a DNA damage response. Significantly, loss of the Seg system also leads to precocious assembly of the key cell division protein CdvA. Finally, we observe interactions between SegA and CdvA, indicating dual roles for the Seg system in effecting chromosome segregation and defining the positioning of the cell division apparatus. Very little is known about the molecular basis of chromosome segregation in archaea. Here, the authors describe conformational changes in the chromosome during the cell cycle of the archaeon Sulfolobus. The changes depend on candidate chromosome segregation proteins that interact with the cell division machinery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Unsteady Sedimentary Dynamics Enhance the Nutrient Regeneration in the Large‐River Delta‐Front Estuary</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025jc022845</link><guid>10.1029/2025jc022845</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 07:35:23 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Zeyun Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guodong Song</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jin Huang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhuoyi Zhu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Dongdong Zhu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sumei Liu</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1029/2025jc022845</prism:doi><description>Abstract Sediments characterized by unsteady dynamics, such as mobile muds (MM), are commonly found in large‐river delta‐front estuaries (LDEs).

On average, the DIN and Si(OH) 4 fluxes of unsteady stations are approximately 3 times those at steady stations, while PO 4 3− fluxes could reach 8 times. These results revealed that ECSMM is an important nutrient source, and regenerated nutrients could sustain &gt;10% of the local primary production. Furthermore, rapid nutrient regeneration in other major LDEs is estimated through published data. The highest fluxes are found in the Amazon Estuary with the thickest unsteady layer and the most intense reworking.

FDX1 reduces ionophore-bound Cu(II) to Cu(I), thereby triggering its release, and promotes mitochondrial protein lipoylation, which is directly targeted by the released copper to drive cell death. Despite the pivotal role of FDX1 in cuproptosis, the structural determinants underlying its distinct functions remain unclear. To address this, we performed deep mutational scanning on FDX1 and find that two conserved solvent-exposed residues, D136 and D139, on alpha helix 3 are essential for both cuproptosis and lipoylation. Charge-reversal mutations at these positions abolish FDX1’s ability to induce cuproptosis and support lipoylation in cells, despite retaining full enzymatic activity in vitro. Guided by structural and genomic analyses, we further identify dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), the E3 subunit of lipoylated complexes as an alternative FDX1 reductase both in cells and in vitro. Together, these findings establish the acidic alpha helix 3 of FDX1 as a critical interface for its upstream regulation and suggest that FDX1’s roles in cuproptosis and in lipoylation are both structurally and functionally linked.

To explore this, we compare the centromere and (epi)genome organization of two sister genera with contrasting centromere types: Chamaelirium luteum with large macro-monocentromeres and Chionographis japonica with holocentromeres. Both exhibit chromosome-wide histone phosphorylation patterns distinct from typical monocentric species.

The broad-scale synteny between both genomes supports de novo holocentromere formation in Chi. japonica . Despite sharing features with both centromere types, macro-monocentromeres do not represent a direct link between mono- and holocentromeres. We propose a model for the divergent evolution involving kinetochore gene mutations, altered histone phosphorylation patterns, and centromeric satellite DNA amplification.

In addition to the effects of streambed heterogeneity, LTNE effects further amplify these errors. Furthermore, the influences of streambed heterogeneity on LTNE effects are primarily influenced by flow velocity, with higher clay content reducing Darcian velocity and weakening LTNE effects.
