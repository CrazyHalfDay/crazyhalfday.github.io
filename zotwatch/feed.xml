In experiments using pelitic schist, talc formed within tree-like fractures in serpentinite, whereas in harzburgite it formed as a layer or wedge-like filling. In the pelitic schist, albite porphyroblasts were preferentially replaced by Mg-rich saponite. These observations and mass balance calculations indicate that: (1) the solid volume-decreasing reactions in serpentinite accompanying reaction-induced fracturing and solid volume-increasing reaction in harzburgite caused the contrasting textures in the two rock types; and (2) Al-bearing minerals in the sedimentary rocks absorbed Mg, which facilitated the overall progress of the Mg-releasing, talc-forming reactions in the mantle rocks. These results suggest that compositional heterogeneity in subducting sediments can produce variations in the talc distribution and rheological properties at the slab–mantle interface, potentially affecting the location of episodic tremor and slip in a mantle wedge corner.

Seawater cerium (III) forms mononuclear complexes in vernadite from global ferromanganese crusts and is oxidized to cerium (IV) during hydrolysis, as shown by atomic-scale analysis and quantum calculations. This leads to strong Ce isotope fractionation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Chainmail-inspired conformable and switchable microwave metamaterial absorber</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68694-9</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-68694-9</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:05:51 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ruiyang Tan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jintang Zhou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ping Chen</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-026-68694-9</prism:doi><description>The rigidity of conventional microwave absorbers impedes their reliable integration with complex curved surfaces and deformable components.

The authors present a decoherent parallel direct laser writing (Dc-PDLW) strategy that combines a patterned single pulse with a de-coherent hologram algorithm to achieve 300 nm (~λ/4) resolution in crystal, enabling centimeter-scale 3D phase plates and dense 3D phase coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Electric-field-driven CO2 polarization and bioinspired proton blocking unlock CO2 reduction in strong acid without metal cations</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68435-y</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-68435-y</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 07:44:36 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Liwei Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhenbin Guo</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hui-Zi Huang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wenjing Tian</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiaoxue Chang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Qiang Hu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Di Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chao Sun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mingming Gao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Suqin Han</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shuhua Lv</dc:creator><dc:creator>Huiqin Zhou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Linyu Hu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hongyu Mou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xing Gao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yuchen Hao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wenxiu Yang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Qunsheng Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bo Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jibin Song</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-026-68435-y</prism:doi><description>Metal-cation-free CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) in strong acidic media mitigates CO2 reactant losses, eliminates the risk of metal salt precipitation, and broadens device tolerance compared to acidic, neutral, or alkaline system using metal cations.

The drainage system that existed along the East Asian margin before the present-day drainage pattern is poorly understood. The basin-and-swell physiography of the East Asian margin was thought to have hindered the formation of large rivers during the early Cenozoic. To reveal drainage reorganizations, we combined regional geological constraints with provenance analysis of the East China Sea Shelf Basin (ECSB). For the first time, we applied coupled zircon and rutile U-Pb chronology to the ECSB, which is a crucial place for tracing river evolution along the East Asian margin. Our results, coupled with data from the literature, document a major regional provenance change in the middle Eocene. Before this change, the zircon age spectra showed only a single peak at ca. 110 Ma, indicating that the sediments were derived solely from proximal sources. After the change, the spectra began to show multiple peaks. These multiple peaks indicate a much larger drainage basin, incorporating several different detrital sources, some of which were located far inland. Detrital rutile shows a dominant age peak at ca. 220 Ma, indicating that most detritus was derived from the southeastern North China Block and Sulu-Dabie orogen. Both the zircon and rutile age spectra indicate that the Korean Peninsula became a main source area following the late Eocene. Coinciding with the major provenance change documented in the ECSB, fluvial sediments filled up the Subei−South Yellow Sea Basin, at which time it became a bypass area for a newly formed, large, southward-flowing axial river, which we term the East Asia Paleoriver. Such tectono-sedimentary evolution was strictly related to rift-basin formation and geodynamic processes driven by Izanagi-Pacific Ridge subduction. The East Asia Paleoriver, sourced from the southeastern North China Block and Sulu-Dabie orogen, and debouching into the ECSB, was established along the East Asian margin in the middle Eocene, expanded in the late Eocene to include the Korean Peninsula, and existed until the middle Miocene. Our findings shed new light on the evolving landscape in East Asia and show how basin and provenance analysis can be combined to reconstruct paleodrainage patterns.

Martian meteorite carbonates display unusually high δ 13 C values, not explained using known terrestrial processes. Carbonates have been detected across the martian surface, including observations by the Perseverance Rover in Jezero Crater. However, the stable isotope effects of surface irradiation in carbonate minerals remain poorly constrained. We investigated the influence of ultraviolet (UV) and non‐UV radiation on δ 13 C and δ 18 O values of carbonates under both Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and laboratory conditions. Three natural carbonates, two calcites (Iceland spar, Bolivian stromatolite) and one aragonite (French microbialite), were exposed to LEO UV and non‐UV radiation for 29 ± 4 hr. Laboratory experiments employed reagent‐grade calcite and natural aragonite exposed to UV under N 2 atmospheres at 6 mbar (4.5 torr) or 1.73 mbar (1.3 torr) for 24–70 hr in the McMaster Planetary Simulator (MPS). Most carbonates showed no significant radiation‐induced changes in their δ 13 C and δ 18 O values. However, three cases exhibited minor stable isotope shifts, including carbon and oxygen isotope effects in LEO and MPS carbonates, an oxygen isotope effect in the LEO‐UV‐exposed French microbialite, and carbon isotope effects in two UV‐exposed MPS calcites. These results suggest that short‐term radiation cannot explain the 13 C enrichment in martian meteorites but may initiate subtle stable isotope effects. This study establishes a baseline for radiation‐induced stable isotope effects in carbonates, informing interpretations of martian carbonate isotopes, biosignature preservation potential, and analyses planned for Mars Sample Return.

We investigated the influence of ultraviolet (UV) and non‐UV radiation on δ 13 C and δ 18 O values of carbonates under both Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and laboratory conditions. Three natural carbonates, two calcites (Iceland spar, Bolivian stromatolite) and one aragonite (French microbialite), were exposed to LEO UV and non‐UV radiation for 29 ± 4 hr. Laboratory experiments employed reagent‐grade calcite and natural aragonite exposed to UV under N 2 atmospheres at 6 mbar (4.5 torr) or 1.73 mbar (1.3 torr) for 24–70 hr in the McMaster Planetary Simulator (MPS). Most carbonates showed no significant radiation‐induced changes in their δ 13 C and δ 18 O values. However, three cases exhibited minor stable isotope shifts, including carbon and oxygen isotope effects in LEO and MPS carbonates, an oxygen isotope effect in the LEO‐UV‐exposed French microbialite, and carbon isotope effects in two UV‐exposed MPS calcites. These results suggest that short‐term radiation cannot explain the 13 C enrichment in martian meteorites but may initiate subtle stable isotope effects. This study establishes a baseline for radiation‐induced stable isotope effects in carbonates, informing interpretations of martian carbonate isotopes, biosignature preservation potential, and analyses planned for Mars Sample Return.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Widespread terrestrial ecosystem disruption at the onset of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2509231122</link><guid>10.1073/pnas.2509231122</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:59:25 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Mei Nelissen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Debra A.

Long-term trends reveal significant increases in vegetation cover (6.8 × 10 −4 /y) and photosynthetic activity (6.1 × 10 −3 W/m 2 /sr/µm/y), accompanied by a strengthening net CO 2 uptake (NEE trend: −5.2 × 10 −12 kg/m 2 /s/y).

Our results provide the direct evidence that human-led intervention can effectively enhance carbon sequestration in even the most extreme arid landscapes, demonstrating the potential to transform a desert into a carbon sink and halt desertification. This underscores the critical role of dryland restoration in global carbon management strategies and highlights the Taklamakan Desert as a model for climate change mitigation through nature-based solutions and ecological engineering.

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis of our model reveals that Nb, Hf, Th/U, Lu, CeAnom, Th, Eu, EuAnom, U, Zr, La, and Lu/Hf constitute the most diagnostically significant variables for discriminating titanite genetic types based on trace element composition, and they further reveal the high coupling and complexity among trace elements in genetic discrimination. In addition, we introduce a visualization approach that combines LightGBM with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to classify titanite by its genesis, achieving pronounced separation between metamorphic and magmatic titanite in high-dimensional feature space. These findings establish that our approach provides a robust framework for both deciphering titanite origins from trace element compositions and predicting titanite genesis across diverse geological settings worldwide.
