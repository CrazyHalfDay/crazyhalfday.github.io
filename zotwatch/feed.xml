The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts. We propose that subducted oceanic crust plays a role similar to that of subducted sediments in recycling FME, such as K, Rb, and Ba, owing to the buffering effect of phengite. Nevertheless, it potentially contributes more significantly to Sr enrichment within the mantle wedge of subduction zones.

Sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane and microbial sulfate reduction are the leading processes driving the removal of organic carbon and sulfur from the environment. Microbial sulfate reduction has been well studied in most marine depositional environments, however, studies examining sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane are primarily limited to shallow burial or methane seep environments. Sediments recovered from IODP site U1553 on the southern Campbell Plateau demonstrate evidence of a deeply buried sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). In this study, we identified a deep (&gt; 500mbsf) sulfate-methane transition zone through the analysis of sulfur isotopes in sulfide minerals (d 34 S CRS ). Three potential paleo-SMTZs were also identified as peaks in d 34 S CRS below the modern SMTZ, suggesting the changing seafloor and depositional conditions since the late Oligocene contributed to the upward migration of the SMTZ over time. Understanding the evolution of deep SMTZs and the processes associated with them will help further constrain how the sulfur and carbon cycles interact and drive carbon storage in marine sediments.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur is a key component in the reduction of organic carbon in marine sediments. Sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane and microbial sulfate reduction are the leading processes driving the removal of organic carbon and sulfur from the environment. Microbial sulfate reduction has been well studied in most marine depositional environments, however, studies examining sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane are primarily limited to shallow burial or methane seep environments. Sediments recovered from IODP site U1553 on the southern Campbell Plateau demonstrate evidence of a deeply buried sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). In this study, we identified a deep (&amp;gt; 500mbsf) sulfate-methane transition zone through the analysis of sulfur isotopes in sulfide minerals (d 34 S CRS ). Three potential paleo-SMTZs were also identified as peaks in d 34 S CRS below the modern SMTZ, suggesting the changing seafloor and depositional conditions since the late Oligocene contributed to the upward migration of the SMTZ over time.

Despite ∼50 Myr separation, both units were emplaced during the Miocene closure, suggesting how contrasting mechanisms may have shaped the KWOC. The OCC model also offers a potential resolution to prior ambiguities in the geodynamic evolution of Peri-Arabic ophiolites.

Existing “dual current” methods for major and trace elements are limited by instrumentation and data volume, and cannot meet large‐scale analytical needs. This study systematically evaluates EPMA parameters to establish general conditions for “single current” in situ determination of major elements, F and Cl in hornblende. Results show optimal F counting stability on TAP/LDE1 crystals at 0–5 μm beam sizes. Long dwell times with high currents reduce DLs to 11 μg g ‐1 (F) and 2 μg g ‐1 (Cl), with BG ± 10 mm yielding lower DLs than ±5 mm. However, currents beyond 100 nA cause loss of major components (notably SiO 2 ), so moderate currents are safer. For hornblende F determination, accuracy prioritises PHA setting &gt; BG correction &gt; probe current &gt; counting time &gt; reference material selection &gt; beam size, whereas Cl is less parameter‐sensitive. A general parameter set for simultaneous in situ major element, F and Cl determination in hornblende is established, with results consistent with literature values for the Kakanui and Arenal hornblende reference materials. This method can be applied to research on magmatic‐hydrothermal evolution, metamorphism and subduction‐zone cycling.

This study systematically evaluates EPMA parameters to establish general conditions for “single current” in situ determination of major elements, F and Cl in hornblende. Results show optimal F counting stability on TAP/LDE1 crystals at 0–5 μm beam sizes. Long dwell times with high currents reduce DLs to 11 μg g ‐1 (F) and 2 μg g ‐1 (Cl), with BG ± 10 mm yielding lower DLs than ±5 mm. However, currents beyond 100 nA cause loss of major components (notably SiO 2 ), so moderate currents are safer. For hornblende F determination, accuracy prioritises PHA setting &amp;gt; BG correction &amp;gt; probe current &amp;gt; counting time &amp;gt; reference material selection &amp;gt; beam size, whereas Cl is less parameter‐sensitive. A general parameter set for simultaneous in situ major element, F and Cl determination in hornblende is established, with results consistent with literature values for the Kakanui and Arenal hornblende reference materials. This method can be applied to research on magmatic‐hydrothermal evolution, metamorphism and subduction‐zone cycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>MOSASAUR TAPHONOMY FROM THE SHARON SPRINGS MEMBER OF THE PIERRE SHALE FORMATION, SOUTH DAKOTA</title><link>https://doi.org/10.2110/palo.2024.002</link><guid>10.2110/palo.2024.002</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:59:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andrew Rich</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sarah W.

In South Dakota, the Pierre Shale Formation is divided by the Missouri River into two geographic regions: the Black Hills Region to the west and the Central/Eastern Region to the east. Both regions have extensive outcrops, including exposures of the Sharon Springs Member. The Sharon Springs Member preserves an abundance of invertebrate and vertebrate fossils, including mosasaurs. Given that fossil-rich outcrops of the Sharon Springs occur in both geographic regions, this study aimed to analyze trends in preservation of mosasaur fossils to determine if there are significant differences in the degree of weathering and geochemistry of fossils. The degree of subaerial and submarine weathering, as indicated by gypsum encrustation and abrasion, was characterized based on physical evidence of alteration. X-ray fluorescence was used to determine the geochemical composition of fossil specimens, including phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), strontium (Sr), and iron (Fe). The mosasaur fossils displayed statistically significant differences in the degrees of weathering across the two regions (p = 0.005) and fossils recovered from the Black Hills Region were more highly weathered. Fossils examined from the Central/Eastern region contained significantly higher Fe concentrations (mean: 62578 ppm) compared to the Black Hills Region (mean: 26438 ppm). The average P, S, and Sr content of fossils preserved in the two regions were not significantly different. Fossils from both regions display high variability in chemical composition, likely reflecting the dynamic nature of early diagenesis and taphonomy. These results suggest that Fe in vertebrate fossils may be a useful indicator of diagenetic conditions in the Western Interior Seaway.
