The chemistry of contemporaneous marine carbonates provides a window into operation of the carbon cycle across this transition. Specifically, carbonate rocks co-eval with the GOE preserve a large and long-lived positive carbon isotope ( δ 13 C) excursion, the Lomagundi–Jatuli excursion (LJE), that canonically is interpreted as an increase in organic matter burial linked to the oxygenation of Earth’s surface. However, the cause, synchroneity, and global nature of the LJE remain contentious due to significant uncertainties in the excursion’s timing and magnitude. These uncertainties stem from the incomplete, time-uncertain, and spatially variable nature of the shallow-water sedimentary record. Here, we use Bayesian inference to reconstruct Paleoproterozoic δ 13 C from globally distributed stratigraphic observations. Our inference reaffirms that the LJE is a global excursion, although its expression varies locally, and provides revised estimates for its timing and magnitude. We find that δ 13 C most likely began to increase at 2,445 Ma, subsequently returning to baseline values at 2,018 Ma. The most likely excursion peak occurs at 2,130 Ma, and it is very unlikely (5% probability) that peak δ 13 C values exceeded 9.1 ‰ . Altogether, our results indicate the LJE has an earlier onset, longer duration, and lower magnitude than previously thought. The initial δ 13 C increase occurs before or contemporaneously with both the earliest rise of atmospheric O 2 and Paleoproterozoic “snowball” glaciations, hinting at a mechanistic link among the LJE, the GOE, and climate.

Constraints on the extent of inland Greenland Ice Sheet retreat during the Middle Holocene (~8–4 thousand years before present) are limited because geological records of a smaller-than-modern phase largely remain beneath the modern ice sheet. We drilled through 509 metres of firn and ice at Prudhoe Dome, northwestern Greenland, to obtain sub-ice material yielding direct evidence for the response of the northwest Greenland ice sheet to Holocene warmth. Here we present infrared stimulated luminescence measurements from sub-ice sediments that indicate that the ground below the summit was exposed to sunlight 7.1 ± 1.1 thousand years ago. This proposed complete deglaciation of Prudhoe Dome, coeval to reduced extent at other ice caps across northern Greenland, is consistent with interglacial-only δ18O values from the Prudhoe Dome ice column and ice depth–age modelling. Our results point to a substantial response of the northwest Greenland ice sheet to early Holocene warming, estimated to be +3–5 °C from palaeoclimate data. This range of summer temperatures is similar to projections of warming by 2100 CE. The ~500-metre-thick Prudhoe Dome in northwestern Greenland completely deglaciated 7,000 years ago, highlighting the sensitivity of the ice sheet to mid-Holocene warming, according to luminescence and geochemical data from sub-ice sediments and ice cores.

&lt;p&gt;Projections of future sea-level rise benefit from understanding the response of past ice sheets to warming during past Quaternary interglacials. Constraints on the extent of inland Greenland Ice Sheet retreat during the Middle Holocene (~8–4 thousand years before present) are limited because geological records of a smaller-than-modern phase largely remain beneath the modern ice sheet. We drilled through 509 metres of firn and ice at Prudhoe Dome, northwestern Greenland, to obtain sub-ice material yielding direct evidence for the response of the northwest Greenland ice sheet to Holocene warmth. Here we present infrared stimulated luminescence measurements from sub-ice sediments that indicate that the ground below the summit was exposed to sunlight 7.1 ± 1.1 thousand years ago. This proposed complete deglaciation of Prudhoe Dome, coeval to reduced extent at other ice caps across northern Greenland, is consistent with interglacial-only δ18O values from the Prudhoe Dome ice column and ice depth–age modelling. Our results point to a substantial response of the northwest Greenland ice sheet to early Holocene warming, estimated to be +3–5 °C from palaeoclimate data. This range of summer temperatures is similar to projections of warming by 2100 CE. The ~500-metre-thick Prudhoe Dome in northwestern Greenland completely deglaciated 7,000 years ago, highlighting the sensitivity of the ice sheet to mid-Holocene warming, according to luminescence and geochemical data from sub-ice sediments and ice cores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Crystallization modulation for wide-bandgap perovskites with universal defect passivation toward efficient perovskite/organic tandem photovoltaics</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-68125-1</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-68125-1</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 02:17:34 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ruixuan Jiang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yikai Yun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kexuan Sun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xinyue Cui</dc:creator><dc:creator>Qi Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chang Hu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chengkai Jin</dc:creator><dc:creator>Qiumin Kong</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yuqiang Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Junbo Gong</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sisi He</dc:creator><dc:creator>Longbin Qiu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chang Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sai Bai</dc:creator><dc:creator>Cheng Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhishan Bo</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fuzhi Huang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yi-Bing Cheng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tongle Bu</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-68125-1</prism:doi><description>Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskites with bandgaps exceeding 1.8 eV are suitable for perovskite/organic or multi-junction tandem solar cell (TSC) applications.

The year 2023 was at the time ‘the hottest year on record’ globally, with Canada’s forests experiencing warm anomalies of above 2 °C and unprecedented drought and wildfires, providing a unique case to examine the response of boreal forest net carbon uptake to climate extremes. Here we combine satellite-based atmospheric CO2 flux inversions with ground-based in situ observations of CO2 fluxes and concentrations to investigate Canada’s forest net carbon uptake and its underlying mechanisms in 2023. We find that, compared with 2015–2022, Canada’s forest net carbon uptake was enhanced by 0.28 ± 0.23 PgC, offsetting 38–48% of Canadian wildfire emissions in 2023. This enhanced net uptake was dominated by large ecosystem respiration reductions, mainly attributable to severe root-zone soil moisture deficits and the unimodal temperature response of respiration. However, most dynamic global vegetation models failed to simulate the respiration reductions and the responses to hydrothermal conditions well. This study improves our understanding of boreal forest net carbon uptake in response to climate extremes and highlights an urgent need to improve vegetation models under global warming. The extreme hot and dry conditions of 2023 reduced soil respiration and enhanced net forest carbon sequestration in Canada, offsetting wildfire emissions, according to satellite-based and in situ observations of CO2 fluxes.

&lt;p&gt;The response of net forest carbon uptake to warm extremes remains elusive. The year 2023 was at the time ‘the hottest year on record’ globally, with Canada’s forests experiencing warm anomalies of above 2 °C and unprecedented drought and wildfires, providing a unique case to examine the response of boreal forest net carbon uptake to climate extremes. Here we combine satellite-based atmospheric CO2 flux inversions with ground-based in situ observations of CO2 fluxes and concentrations to investigate Canada’s forest net carbon uptake and its underlying mechanisms in 2023. We find that, compared with 2015–2022, Canada’s forest net carbon uptake was enhanced by 0.28 ± 0.23 PgC, offsetting 38–48% of Canadian wildfire emissions in 2023. This enhanced net uptake was dominated by large ecosystem respiration reductions, mainly attributable to severe root-zone soil moisture deficits and the unimodal temperature response of respiration. However, most dynamic global vegetation models failed to simulate the respiration reductions and the responses to hydrothermal conditions well. This study improves our understanding of boreal forest net carbon uptake in response to climate extremes and highlights an urgent need to improve vegetation models under global warming. The extreme hot and dry conditions of 2023 reduced soil respiration and enhanced net forest carbon sequestration in Canada, offsetting wildfire emissions, according to satellite-based and in situ observations of CO2 fluxes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Pattern of Inner‐Core Differential Rotation From Long‐Term Earthquake Sequences and USArray Network</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025gl119295</link><guid>10.1029/2025gl119295</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 03:37:11 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kaixin Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiaodong Song</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yi Yang</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Geophysical Research Letters</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1029/2025gl119295</prism:doi><description>Abstract How the differential rotation of the Earth's inner core (IC) has changed over time provides insights into the dynamics of the Earth's interior.

Results from two pathways, South Sandwich Islands to Alaska (1982–2024) and Kuril Islands to Argentina (1994–2024), reveal a consistent pattern that the IC successively rotated faster than the mantle by about from the early 1980s and decelerated to a near‐zero rate around 2000, perhaps slower than the mantle after about 2010.

Here we demonstrate a smart end-linked polymer network that “self-strengthen” during use yet “self-destruct” upon certain stimuli. Embedding nonscissile cyclobutane-fused tetrahydrofuran mechanophores within the middle of end-linked polymer networks significantly enhances both toughness and degradability. Under mechanical stress, the force-coupled cycloreversion of these mechanophores releases concealed chain segments, enabling single-network materials to exhibit threefold toughness and tenfold tear energies compared to conventional counterparts. Additionally, ball-milling griding of the bulk material unveils acid-sensitive enol ether units, leading to a markedly improved degradation profile under acidic conditions. This dual effect—originating from the force-coupled cycloreversion of cyclobutane-fused tetrahydrofuran mechanophores—provides an ideal combination of superior mechanical performance and on-demand degradability. Achieving both high toughness and degradability in mechanophore containing polymer networks is a challenge. Here, the authors incorporated non-scissile cyclobutane-fused tetrahydrofuran mechanophores into end-linked polymer networks to enhance their toughness and degradability through mechanically triggered cycloreversion reactions.

We estimate global trends of post-fire soil erosion using a global database on wildfire occurrence and fire severity, and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model together with the recovery of those burned landscapes by remote sensed data.

Globally, Africa is the continent that is impacted the most in terms of post-fire soil erosion, given its substantially larger burned area. Our results illustrate the magnitude of post-fire soil erosion globally and therefore support post-fire management actions towards the mitigation and restoration of affected areas and policies towards land-degradation neutrality.
