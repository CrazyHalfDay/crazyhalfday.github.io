Here, we present whole-rock geochemical and Ba–Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic data for basalts from the sediment-rich Luzon Arc and the sediment-poor Bicol Arc to constrain the recycling processes of fluid mobile elements (FME) in different subduction settings. Our results suggest that the mantle wedge beneath the Luzon and Bicol arcs was primarily metasomatized by melts from subducted sediments and fluids from subducted oceanic crust, respectively. The basalts from both arcs show variable δ 138/134 Ba values despite their limited variations in Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopes, reflecting the heterogeneous dehydration of phengite in subducted sediments and oceanic crust, which have undergone different extents of Ba isotopic fractionation at shallow depths.

This defines a distinct Ba isotopic lightening trend across the arc, reflecting progressive Ba isotopic fractionation associated with enhanced phengite dehydration at increasing subduction depths. The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts. We propose that subducted oceanic crust plays a role similar to that of subducted sediments in recycling FME, such as K, Rb, and Ba, owing to the buffering effect of phengite. Nevertheless, it potentially contributes more significantly to Sr enrichment within the mantle wedge of subduction zones.

The process can create normal-fault-bounded core complexes hundreds of kilometers wide, in which metamorphic continental crust derived from the subducting plate is exposed. Horizontal tectonic stress and the thickness of the downgoing upper crust control the width of complexes, their topographic elevation, and the subduction depth of exposed rocks. We propose that the Rhodope Metamorphic Complex on the Balkan Peninsula represents a prime example for such vertical extrusion internal of a suture zone. Lower tectonic units in this domain exhibit Eocene high-pressure metamorphism and nappe stacking followed by massive magmatism and large-offset normal faulting. Despite more than 100 km of extension in Cenozoic times, the area still has thick crust. Our modeling results support schemes that attribute the lower units of the Rhodope Metamorphic Complex to the subducted Adriatic plate.

&lt;p&gt;We explore the fate of subducted continental margins using thermomechanical modeling with constant-force boundary conditions.

Based on newly obtained Mo isotope data for these Mesozoic xenoliths, the juvenile lower crust beneath the Cathaysia Block is enriched in extremely light Mo isotopes compared to the mantle. It is proposed that widely distributed fluids in the crust may be an important reservoir for balancing Earth's Mo isotope system. In this context, molybdenum isotope fingerprinting of fluid activities constitutes a significant approach for investigating crustal differentiation.

Py2c is As-Cu-Pb-Ag-Au-rich (initial gold enrichment), suggestive of fluid boiling during its formation, corroborated by low δ 34 S values (avg. −3.83‰) and hydrothermal breccias. In contrast, Py2r is depleted in these elements, indicative of non-boiling conditions, further supported by heavier δ 34 S values (avg. −2.53‰). Several pieces of evidence, including sharp reaction fronts and As-Au contents differences between Py2c and Py3, and Py2c remnants and mineral inclusions (chalcopyrite, galena, and native gold) within Py3, indicate the CDR process, during which Au in Py2c was remobilized and reprecipitated as native gold. The CDR process is triggered by oxidation of the mineralizing fluids, consistent with the decreasing δ 34 S values from Py2r to Py3. Combined with higher Co-Ni concentrations in Py3 (similar to Py2c) relative to Py2r, we infer that fluid oxidation is associated with hydraulic fracturing restart. Multiple sulfur isotopes (δ 34 S: −4.92 to 0.45‰; Δ 33 S: −0.05 ± 0.10‰) and low Co-Ni and high Se contents of pyrite suggest a magmatic fluid origin from a possible concealed intrusion. This study underscores magmatic-hydrothermal contributions in forming lode gold deposits in Dayaoshan, and highlights the importance of pressure-driven hydrothermal processes in initial gold precipitation, remobilization, and reprecipitation within gold deposits.

Higher reported R S/P values for smaller ULVZs near subduction zones may therefore indicate different processes at play controlling ULVZ formation across the diverse core-mantle boundary landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Mineralization processes for sphalerite in MVT deposits: Insights from the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang ore field, Guizhou, Southwest China</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs2025-125</link><guid>10.1144/jgs2025-125</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:01:17 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Weijun He</dc:creator><dc:creator>Youguo Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sigen Ma</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Journal of the Geological Society</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1144/jgs2025-125</prism:doi><description>Although Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposit mineralization processes are well characterized, the associated ore-forming fluids, which are crucial to understanding Pb and Zn mineralization, should be investigated further.

This study aims to characterize Zn mineralization in the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field, Southwest China. The rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol2) from the syn-ore stage vary between 5.63 and 32.50 ppm (with an average of 14.07 ppm), whereas in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol3) from post-ore stage, the values range from 45.63 to 95.69 ppm (with an average of 72.03 ppm). The fluid inclusions of Dol2 and Dol3 exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 98–204°C (with an average of 143°C) and 98–195°C (with an average of 132°C), with corresponding salinity ranges of 13.0–29.5 wt% (with an average of 20.9 wt%) and 16.0–25.7 wt% (with an average of 18.9 wt%) NaCl equivalent, respectively. Sphalerite inclusions exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 95–230°C (with a mean of 143°C) and salinities ranging from 13.8–28.9 wt% (with a mean of 23.7 wt%) NaCl. The δ 13 C fluid , δ D fluid , and δ 18 O fluid values of the ore-forming fluids range from -4.4‰ to -3.8‰ (with a mean of -4.1‰), -36.4‰ to -27.8‰ (with a mean of -31.9‰), and 4.9‰ to 5.7‰ (with a mean of 5.3‰), respectively. In this study, an Fe- and Zn-enriched NaCl-H₂O basement brine is identified as the ore-forming fluid responsible for the Zn-rich MVT deposits. During its low- to medium-temperature migration, the fluid was channelled by the Mandong fault and Wangsi anticline structural framework, which provided ideal pathways and traps. During migration, the fluid leached sulfur (reduced from evaporites to H 2 S) from wall rocks and ultimately precipitated within dolomite faults and fractures. The distinct Zn-rich character of the deposits stems from the following two key factors: a primary derivation from the Zn-rich basement of the Yangtze Block and a chemical preference for Zn enrichment, which is driven by the differing fractionation coefficients of Zn- and Pb-chloride complexes in the NaCl–H 2 O system. This study advances the understanding of the genesis of MVT deposits worldwide.

We interpret this feature as diapiric upwelling that links melt sources beneath the arc and back-arc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Tracking deep mantle heat and volatiles in the Iceland plume from a high-density survey of helium isotopes along the Reykjanes Ridge</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2026.119882</link><guid>10.1016/j.epsl.2026.119882</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:24:36 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>U.

The limited exhumation corresponds to weak deformation within the inner zone. Integrating geological and geophysical data, we suggest that the late Permian plume activity emplaced voluminous mantle-derived mafic-ultramafic intrusions into the crust beneath the ELIP’s inner zone, increasing crustal rigidity and resistance to Cenozoic deformation and exhumation. Our findings highlight how plume-related lithospheric modification may exert a lasting influence on intraplate deformation, persisting hundreds of millions of years after plume cessation.

We investigated how fracture aperture and surface roughness influence mineralization by reacting synthetic forsteritic olivine fractures with controlled apertures (0.5–1.6 millimeters) and roughness (6–16 micrometers) with supercritical carbon dioxide at 13.7 megapascals and 185 degrees Celsius. Optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy showed that rougher fracture surfaces promoted iron oxide precipitation, which passivated olivine surfaces, limiting magnesium availability for carbonate formation while removing iron as a reactant. These effects were more pronounced in smaller-aperture fractures. A geochemical model incorporating surface topography and passivation reproduced the observed trends, confirming that increased roughness can reduce reactivity despite greater surface area. Our results demonstrate that fracture microstructure strongly influences iron oxide passivation and carbon dioxide mineralization, with important implications for predicting long-term performance of engineered carbon dioxide storage systems. Rougher surfaces in smaller apertures olivine fractures increase reactive surface area but hinder efficient carbon dioxide mineralization by promoting passivating iron oxide precipitates, according to an integrated experimental and modeling study.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient carbon dioxide mineralization in silicate-rich formations depends on reaction rates within fracture networks, yet the role of fracture microstructure remains poorly constrained. We investigated how fracture aperture and surface roughness influence mineralization by reacting synthetic forsteritic olivine fractures with controlled apertures (0.5–1.6 millimeters) and roughness (6–16 micrometers) with supercritical carbon dioxide at 13.7 megapascals and 185 degrees Celsius. Optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy showed that rougher fracture surfaces promoted iron oxide precipitation, which passivated olivine surfaces, limiting magnesium availability for carbonate formation while removing iron as a reactant. These effects were more pronounced in smaller-aperture fractures. A geochemical model incorporating surface topography and passivation reproduced the observed trends, confirming that increased roughness can reduce reactivity despite greater surface area. Our results demonstrate that fracture microstructure strongly influences iron oxide passivation and carbon dioxide mineralization, with important implications for predicting long-term performance of engineered carbon dioxide storage systems. Rougher surfaces in smaller apertures olivine fractures increase reactive surface area but hinder efficient carbon dioxide mineralization by promoting passivating iron oxide precipitates, according to an integrated experimental and modeling study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Multi-mineral control on Fe isotopic variations during crustal anatexis: Implications for heterogeneous Fe isotopic composition in granitic systems</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2026.123272</link><guid>10.1016/j.chemgeo.2026.123272</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:20:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Zheng Sun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shengyao Yu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiaocong Jiang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yinbiao Peng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Dongyong Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chuanzhi Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lintao Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xingzhou Jiang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Qi Liu</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Chemical Geology</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1016/j.chemgeo.2026.123272</prism:doi><description>Iron (Fe) isotopes provide a powerful tracer of crustal anatexis, yet their application is complicated by isotopic heterogeneity arising from multi-mineral processes during melting and melt evolution. To address this issue, we present an integrated Fe isotope dataset for whole-rocks and key minerals (e.g., biotite and ilmenite) from a continuous granitic gneiss-migmatite-pegmatite sequence in the North Qaidam ultrahigh-pressure belt.

Resulting diatexites and leucosomes show elevated δ 56 Fe (0.13–0.16‰; 0.15–0.24‰) relative to the protolith (0.09–0.11‰) and melanosomes (0.04–0.09‰). After evaluating the effects of weathering/alteration, diffusion, and fluid exsolution, multi-mineral interactions are inferred to be the primary driver of Fe fractionation during crustal anatexis: (1) The retention of ilmenite (δ 56 Fe = −0.16 ± 0.01‰) in the residue resulted in significant Fe isotope fractionation between melanosomes and leucosomes. (2) Peritectic biotite in diatexites exhibits higher δ 56 Fe values (0.18 ± 0.03‰) than residual biotite (0.10 ± 0.02‰) and its entrainment elevated the 56 Fe values in the diatexites during melt migration. (3) Pegmatites display the highest δ 56 Fe (0.22–0.26‰), largely reflecting feldspar accumulation. These results demonstrate that ilmenite retention, peritectic biotite entrainment, and feldspar accumulation collectively generate substantial Fe isotopic heterogeneity in anatectic granites. Fe isotopes thus serve as a sensitive tracer for constraining multi-mineral interactions during crustal anatexis, with broader implications for understanding crustal melting and granite genesis.
