The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts. We propose that subducted oceanic crust plays a role similar to that of subducted sediments in recycling FME, such as K, Rb, and Ba, owing to the buffering effect of phengite. Nevertheless, it potentially contributes more significantly to Sr enrichment within the mantle wedge of subduction zones.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Spatiotemporal correlations between moderate-to-large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions indicate that earthquake-induced stress changes can trigger eruptions. Triggering is rarely instantaneous, with time-dependent processes inferred to mediate magma ascent to the surface, such as fracture propagation or fluid pressurization.

Our results demonstrate that the KWOC was shaped by two distinct geodynamic mechanisms: subduction initiation in the Cretaceous and oceanic core complex formation in the Eocene. Despite ∼50 Myr separation, both units were emplaced during the Miocene closure, suggesting how contrasting mechanisms may have shaped the KWOC. The OCC model also offers a potential resolution to prior ambiguities in the geodynamic evolution of Peri-Arabic ophiolites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Unveiling the environmental impact of earthquakes in Europe</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-68120-6</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-68120-6</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:46:13 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Martina Caruso</dc:creator><dc:creator>Vitor Silva</dc:creator><dc:creator>Karim Aljawhari</dc:creator><dc:creator>Al Mouayed Bellah Nafeh</dc:creator><dc:creator>Carmine Galasso</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-68120-6</prism:doi><description>Earthquakes represent a significant but often overlooked environmental burden in the construction sector, driven by post-disaster repairs and reconstruction that&amp;nbsp;generate substantial carbon emissions.

These deeper storage melts likely reached water saturation during ascent towards the upper crust, inducing degassing and crystallization, which increased viscosity and enabled stalling in the cold crust, explaining the lack of initial mafic eruptions and providing the efficient trapping mechanism in a thermally immature crust. Progressive drying of the source and generation of less hydrous magmas initiated the eruptions and construction of the stratovolcano, and ultimately terminated the system. As a result, the final eruption extruded somewhat drier (4–4.5 ± 0.35 wt% H 2 O), hotter (930–960 ± 45 °C) pyroxene-bearing andesites erupted from water-undersaturated storage. This trapping mechanism of water-rich magmas may explain the typical scarcity of mafic volcanism in arc and post-collisional settings.

In the asthenosphere below the backarc region, fast axes are mainly oriented northeast–southwest, which is consistent with southwestward mantle flow and extrusion tectonics, and suggests strong lithosphere–asthenosphere coupling. Anisotropy weakens below ∼200 km, indicating an increased vertical olivine alignment due to slab steepening. A two‐layer anisotropic structure in the backarc region suggests the presence of lithosphere fabrics unrelated to recent dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Magmatic degassing as the primary source of salt in Archean oceans</title><link>https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/11513/download/20829/</link><guid>oai:EA:id:11513</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:13:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ranta, Eemu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fusswinkel, Tobias</dc:creator><dc:creator>Beier, Christoph</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bali, Eniko</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>EarthArXiv</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.31223/X52472</prism:doi><description>The salinification of Earth’s early oceans impacted both the climate and the evolution of life.

Our data show that the magmatic degassing fractionates the halogens and generates fluids with high Br/Cl and I/Cl that match with Archean seawater. These observations suggest that seawater salinity in the Archean oceans was primarily regulated via fluids exsolved from cooling intrusions during genesis of early crust, and that the mantle had a modern-like halogen composition by 3.5 Ga. Our findings highlight the strong connection between the chemistry of the mantle, magmatic fluids and the oceans, with implications for understanding the chemical environments that guided the evolution of early marine organisms.

In the Seattle fault zone (SFZ), Washington, USA, we present new paleoseismic, geomorphic, and geophysical evidence for late Pleistocene and Holocene earthquakes on shallow, south-dipping secondary faults—the Lytle Beach and Vasa Park faults—that lie within the hanging wall of the greater SFZ and are on trend with the primary, blind Blakely Harbor fault. Our data show that these structures have ruptured independently, producing localized uplift and deformation at the surface, with the most recent event (RH2) likely occurring in the early nineteenth century. While a temporal overlap between the late Pleistocene RH1 and VP1 earthquakes raises the possibility of a ≥35 km rupture along the Blakely Harbor fault, structural and temporal evidence instead supports independent rupture on individual faults related to folding. We interpret these faults as bending-moment reverse faults that formed within a synclinal hinge zone of the main fault, reflecting mechanical and kinematic influences of the broader fault system. Combined with prior studies, our findings indicate that faulting related to folding dominates the mode of strain release within the SFZ since the late Pleistocene with more frequent earthquake recurrence (∼350 yr) over the past ∼2500 yr.
