The Yitong cumulate orthopyroxenites, representing silica-rich melts, have lower δ26Mg and higher δ66Zn values than mantle peridotites, implying that recycled carbonate has been involved in these silica-rich melts. The Yitong cumulate wehrlites and (olivine) websterites display major element compositions similar to those of carbonated peridotite melts, coupled with low whole-rock and clinopyroxene δ26Mg values, high δ66Zn and δ57Fe values, indicating the occurrence of carbonated silicate melts. The transition from orthopyroxenites to (olivine) websterites is marked by the decreasing of their whole-rock δ26Mg, δ57Fe values and Zn/Fe ratios and increasing of their δ66Zn values, along with decreasing of their crystallization temperatures, suggesting that silica-rich melts were gradually transformed into carbonated silicate melts via continuous interaction with carbonated peridotite. Our findings demonstrate that silica-rich melts from the stagnant slab can extract carbon from pre-existing carbonated mantle within the big mantle wedge.

With more than 0.7 million tonnes (Mt) of Zn reserves at average grades ranging from 4–8%, the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field comprises representative deposits such as those of Caiyuanhe, Heli, and Qingshuitang. The ore bodies, which exhibit stratiform, vein-like, and lenticular forms, are hosted within the Cambrian Qingxudong Formation dolomite and are spatially associated with the NE-trending Mandong fault. This Zn ore field in Southwest China is a classic example of Zn-rich mineralization. However, the genetic mechanisms and processes responsible for the Zn-rich nature of these MVT Pb‒Zn deposits remain poorly understood. This study aims to characterize Zn mineralization in the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field, Southwest China. The rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol2) from the syn-ore stage vary between 5.63 and 32.50 ppm (with an average of 14.07 ppm), whereas in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol3) from post-ore stage, the values range from 45.63 to 95.69 ppm (with an average of 72.03 ppm). The fluid inclusions of Dol2 and Dol3 exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 98–204°C (with an average of 143°C) and 98–195°C (with an average of 132°C), with corresponding salinity ranges of 13.0–29.5 wt% (with an average of 20.9 wt%) and 16.0–25.7 wt% (with an average of 18.9 wt%) NaCl equivalent, respectively. Sphalerite inclusions exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 95–230°C (with a mean of 143°C) and salinities ranging from 13.8–28.9 wt% (with a mean of 23.7 wt%) NaCl. The δ 13 C fluid , δ D fluid , and δ 18 O fluid values of the ore-forming fluids range from -4.4‰ to -3.8‰ (with a mean of -4.1‰), -36.4‰ to -27.8‰ (with a mean of -31.9‰), and 4.9‰ to 5.7‰ (with a mean of 5.3‰), respectively. In this study, an Fe- and Zn-enriched NaCl-H₂O basement brine is identified as the ore-forming fluid responsible for the Zn-rich MVT deposits. During its low- to medium-temperature migration, the fluid was channelled by the Mandong fault and Wangsi anticline structural framework, which provided ideal pathways and traps. During migration, the fluid leached sulfur (reduced from evaporites to H 2 S) from wall rocks and ultimately precipitated within dolomite faults and fractures. The distinct Zn-rich character of the deposits stems from the following two key factors: a primary derivation from the Zn-rich basement of the Yangtze Block and a chemical preference for Zn enrichment, which is driven by the differing fractionation coefficients of Zn- and Pb-chloride complexes in the NaCl–H 2 O system. This study advances the understanding of the genesis of MVT deposits worldwide.

The monzogranites’ high K2O and large-ion lithophile elements suggest the role of a sediment-derived enriched mantle source in their origin. The rhyolite-MELTS and Magma Chamber Simulator modeling results suggest the monzogranites’ parental melt resulted from a silicic metasomatized phlogopite-stabilized lithospheric mantle wedge that underwent subsequent lower crust assimilation. The polybaric (∼6−4 kbar) crystallization of the generated assimilated melt formed the monzogranites with plagioclase and K-feldspar as the dominant crystallizing phase (&amp;gt;50%).

The rhyolite-MELTS geobarometer suggests the highly felsic melts separated from the crystal mush between ∼3.8 kbar and 2.8 kbar and emplaced at subvolcanic levels as failed rhyolite eruptions. We suggest the HSGs represent extracted evolved melt, while monzogranites represent residual silicic cumulates formed in a syn- to postcollisional setting during Gondwana assembly.

With mantle density inferred from high‐resolution tomography models and numerical methods solving the governing equations of viscous mantle flow, the modeled geoid can fit the observations well. However, there is still a large discrepancy between present dynamic topography predicted by mantle flow and residual topography deduced from observations: Especially, large negative topography is predicted in cratons, contrary to observations. In order to improve the fit of model dynamic topography compared to observations, in this study, we include chemical density anomalies in Earth's lithosphere to model geoid and dynamic topography. We also combine these anomalies with lateral viscosity variations and study the effect on predicted dynamic topography and geoid and investigate which density models would yield a good fit. In the sublithospheric mantle, under the assumption that the density anomalies are induced from temperature variations, we use temperature‐dependent viscosity. Our results show that by adding chemical density anomalies in the continental lithosphere, we can improve the correlation between dynamic topography and residual topography by 37%–59% for the three tomography models compared with one of the residual tomography models considered (RT1) and 1%–11% compared with the other (RT2). Similarly, correlation can also be improved and amplitude ratio brought closer to 1 by downscaling lithospheric density anomalies. Our results could provide a good reference for further studies of the Earth's mantle.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Mantle convection causes the most important contribution to the geoid and dynamic topography. With mantle density inferred from high‐resolution tomography models and numerical methods solving the governing equations of viscous mantle flow, the modeled geoid can fit the observations well. However, there is still a large discrepancy between present dynamic topography predicted by mantle flow and residual topography deduced from observations: Especially, large negative topography is predicted in cratons, contrary to observations. In order to improve the fit of model dynamic topography compared to observations, in this study, we include chemical density anomalies in Earth&amp;#x27;s lithosphere to model geoid and dynamic topography. We also combine these anomalies with lateral viscosity variations and study the effect on predicted dynamic topography and geoid and investigate which density models would yield a good fit. In the sublithospheric mantle, under the assumption that the density anomalies are induced from temperature variations, we use temperature‐dependent viscosity. Our results show that by adding chemical density anomalies in the continental lithosphere, we can improve the correlation between dynamic topography and residual topography by 37%–59% for the three tomography models compared with one of the residual tomography models considered (RT1) and 1%–11% compared with the other (RT2). Similarly, correlation can also be improved and amplitude ratio brought closer to 1 by downscaling lithospheric density anomalies. Our results could provide a good reference for further studies of the Earth&amp;#x27;s mantle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
