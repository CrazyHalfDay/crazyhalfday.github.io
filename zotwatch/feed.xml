However, how the flat subduction of PPP formed and regulated the lithosphere and topography remain unclear. To address these issues, ca. 243 Ma gabbroic-dioritic samples from Well NK-1, southern South China Sea, were analyzed for element, Sr-Nd isotopic, and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions. The data are integrated with ∼3461 geochemical datasets for ca. 265−200 Ma counterpart rocks from the ESCB. The studied rocks originated from a metasomatized lithospheric mantle. All data reveal that the flat subduction of the PPP transitioned from a high-angle subduction. During this transition, the ESCB lithosphere underwent sequential thinning (ca. 265−254 Ma), thickening (ca. 253−241 Ma), and thinning (ca. 240−200 Ma), driven by lithospheric extension, compression, and mechanical erosion, respectively. The high magma migration rates (&amp;gt;42 km/m.y.) during ca. 253−235 Ma indicate a rapid trench-ward movement of the ESCB, which, together with lithospheric thickening, probably facilitated the formation of flat-slab subduction. In addition, the reconstructed paleo-elevation patterns correlate well with the variations in lithospheric thickness of the ESCB. Correspondingly, the reduced and enhanced continental weathering was controlled by elevation lowering and rising during the Late Permian and Early Triassic, respectively, and our study shows that the elevation-controlled variable weathering rates may cause decreases and increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These findings elucidate the feedback mechanisms linking tectonism, lithosphere, topography, and environment.

Furthermore, our results agree with geophysical observations indicating slab stagnation in the deep mantle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Broadband and high-resolution snapshot spectroscopy with high-index transition metal dichalcogenides</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68685-w</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-68685-w</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 06:36:10 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jianghong Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bangjie Shao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yuting Ye</dc:creator><dc:creator>Qingyan Deng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jialing Jian</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xixi Jiang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yafei Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lan Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yang Chai</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-026-68685-w</prism:doi><description>Computational spectroscopy is a powerful tool across numerous disciplines, yet its development remains constrained by limited bandwidth and low light throughput of spectral encoders, which are inherent to optical materials and design frameworks.

However, the synergetic catalysis between metal center and ligating atoms remains underexplored in single-atom catalysis. Herein, we construct the Pd(II)-N4 sites on carbon nitride to achieve photocatalytic semi-hydrogenation of alkynes. Under light irradiation, the Pd-N sites could transform to H-Pd···N-H moieties. The Pd-H center enhances alkyne insertion while the adjacent N-H group facilitates intramolecular proton transfer. This metal-ligand cooperativity of H-Pd···N-H sites, together with the steric-hindrance imposed by carbon nitride scaffold, lowers the energy barrier for Z-alkene formation and ensures exclusive stereoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;In single-atom catalysts, the coordination microenvironment surrounding transition-metal centers is widely recognized as a key factor shaping their electronic structures and geometries, thereby governing catalytic behaviors. However, the synergetic catalysis between metal center and ligating atoms remains underexplored in single-atom catalysis. Herein, we construct the Pd(II)-N4 sites on carbon nitride to achieve photocatalytic semi-hydrogenation of alkynes. Under light irradiation, the Pd-N sites could transform to H-Pd···N-H moieties. The Pd-H center enhances alkyne insertion while the adjacent N-H group facilitates intramolecular proton transfer. This metal-ligand cooperativity of H-Pd···N-H sites, together with the steric-hindrance imposed by carbon nitride scaffold, lowers the energy barrier for Z-alkene formation and ensures exclusive stereoselectivity. Simultaneously, the H-Pd···N-H sites exhibit stronger adsorption toward alkynes than alkenes, effectively suppressing over-hydrogenation to alkanes. Across all evaluated substrates, Z-alkenes are the only isomers detected, excluding E-isomer and alkane. Notably, in a 5:95 mixture of diphenylacetylene and Z-stilbene, this method selectively converts only the alkyne to the Z-isomer without over-hydrogenation, highlighting its potential for product purification.

However, the reaction efficiency in continuous flow electrochemistry is currently unsatisfactory due to restricted mass transport at the two-phase boundary. Here we present an effective flow management strategy involving electrolyzer structural optimization to intensify the localized electrochemical process. We demonstrate this approach using the electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime from cyclohexanone and nitrite as a representative example. The cathodic counterpart is regulated by a flow-through channel architecture that drives the significant electrolyte convection throughout the porous electrode matrix and minimizes the hydrodynamic diffusion distance, giving the catalyst full accessibility to the feedstock. Using an optimal cobalt single-atom catalyst, we demonstrate the oxime electrosynthesis with a Faradaic efficiency of over 95%, regardless of the operating conditions. Furthermore, we achieve a high single-pass conversion efficiency of up to 95% by balancing the supply of feedstocks between cyclohexanone and in situ generated hydroxylamine through subtle control of the electrolyte flow rate. This continuous-flow electrosynthesis process demonstrates long-term stability, operating for up to 110 hours without the loss of activity, which highlights its great potential for practical implementation. The efficient mass transport is the key factor to advancing the flow-electrocatalytic chemosynthesis. Here, the authors design a flow-through architecture in flow electrolyzer, reinforcing mass transport in the electrolyte to achieve the high efficiency of continuous oxime electrosynthesis.

The cathodic counterpart is regulated by a flow-through channel architecture that drives the significant electrolyte convection throughout the porous electrode matrix and minimizes the hydrodynamic diffusion distance, giving the catalyst full accessibility to the feedstock. Using an optimal cobalt single-atom catalyst, we demonstrate the oxime electrosynthesis with a Faradaic efficiency of over 95%, regardless of the operating conditions. Furthermore, we achieve a high single-pass conversion efficiency of up to 95% by balancing the supply of feedstocks between cyclohexanone and in situ generated hydroxylamine through subtle control of the electrolyte flow rate. This continuous-flow electrosynthesis process demonstrates long-term stability, operating for up to 110 hours without the loss of activity, which highlights its great potential for practical implementation. The efficient mass transport is the key factor to advancing the flow-electrocatalytic chemosynthesis. Here, the authors design a flow-through architecture in flow electrolyzer, reinforcing mass transport in the electrolyte to achieve the high efficiency of continuous oxime electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Residence time of Hunga stratospheric water vapour perturbation quantified at 9 years</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-026-03216-5</link><guid>10.1038/s43247-026-03216-5</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:34:45 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Xin Zhou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Quanliang Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wuhu Feng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Saffron Heddell</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sandip S.

Based on experimental thermodynamic observations and computer simulations, it was hypothesized that below this temperature and at pressures of several kbar, water undergoes a liquid–liquid phase transition (LLPT) and the transition line ends at a second critical point. However, challenges in experiments and simulations at such deep cooling leave doubts about the nature of the LLPT and the existence of the critical point.
