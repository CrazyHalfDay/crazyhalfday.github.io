These intrusions and breccias at depth (&amp;gt;1,000 m below the present-day surface) are associated with Cu-Au mineralization of chalcopyrite and lesser bornite and molybdenite coupled with K-silicate alteration, which formed between 10.55 ± 0.05 and 10.1 ± 0.04 Ma, as determined by molybdenite Re-Os dating.

The upper part of the lithocap consists of a 100- to 200-m-thick, concentrically zoned, advanced argillic alteration—characterized by different proportions of quartz, alunite, kaolinite, and pyrophyllite—centered on stratiform or structurally controlled zones of massive and vuggy quartz. These zones host discrete Au-bearing enargite epithermal mineralization, which occurs as hydrothermal breccias, veins, and open-space fillings, which seem to be the remnants of a larger eroded high-sulfidation system. Muscovite and alunite Ar-Ar ages from zones of white mica and advanced argillic alteration, respectively, yielded ages between 10.151 ± 0.024 and 10.038 ± 0.014 that overlap with the age of porphyry intrusion and associated mineralization, suggesting that porphyry and epithermal mineralization at Valeriano formed over a short period of between 690 and 510 k.y. Advanced argillic alteration transitions outward and upward to intermediate argillic alteration over a distance of 200 to 500 m, which in turn transitions sharply into weakly altered to unaltered rocks in the uppermost lateral portion of the system, suggesting that the Valeriano lithocap was partially blind.

The stratiform-like chromitites in the Bursa ophiolite consist of rhythmically alternating chromite and olivine bands, with chromite displaying similar major element compositions to those in the mantle sequence (e.g., Cr#) but higher Mn, Co, Sc, Ti contents, and lower V/Sc ratios. This suggests that the chromite in ophiolitic stratiform-like chromitites crystallized from evolved melts/fluids with a higher oxygen fugacity than podiform chromitites. In addition, profile analyses reveal a sharp compositional change in chromite and olivine near the contact between the chromite band/chromitite and the olivine band/dunite in banded chromitite from the Bursa ophiolite, NW Türkiye, and mantle transect amphibole-bearing chromitite-dunite sample collected from the Lycian ophiolite, SW Türkiye. Combined with the gradual compositional variation of olivine in olivine band/dunite section, the melts/fluids-mediated modification of olivine is required. The invariable composition of olivine in amphibole-present profile of 18LN07-9 suggests that the fluids released from chromite surfaces serve as a good candidate, as the crystallization of interstitial amphibole from penetrating fluids impeded further modification. Similarly, the analogous compositional trends observed in the Bursa ophiolite can also be attributed to the fluids-olivine interaction. This is supported by the positive correlation between the extent of serpentinization with the modal content of chromite in chromitite, implying the fluids resulting from the wetting property of chromite were also involved in forming stratiform-like chromitites. Therefore, we tentatively propose a genetic link between podiform and stratiform-like chromitites: in the mantle sequence, podiform chromitites formed cumulates within magma conduits. Here, the hydrous fluids collected on the chromite surfaces penetrated into the surrounding peridotite, modifying the composition of pre-existing minerals and crystallized hydrous minerals like amphibole. Subsequently, evolved melts migrated upward into the MCTZ and crystallized the stratiform-like chromitites in the magma chamber at the crustal level. The fluids released from chromite surface play a significant role in modifying mineral compositions both in podiform and stratiform-like chromitites.

Here, the authors develop a lightweight aerogel-based vapor percolator that reconstructs vapor flow through integrated micro-nano tunnels, enabling ultra-fast cooling up to 1,000 °C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Magmatic and Tectonic Structures in the Crust Beneath Armenia and Surrounding Regions of Lesser Caucasus Inferred From Body‐Wave Earthquake Tomography</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025gc012592</link><guid>10.1029/2025gc012592</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 08:50:03 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ivan Koulakov</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lilit Sargsyan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ara Levonyan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Elya Sahakyan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mikayel Gevorgyan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Khachatur Meliksetian</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1029/2025gc012592</prism:doi><description>Abstract The Armenian Highlands, a tectonically active segment of the Arabia‐Eurasia collision zone, exhibit widespread Quaternary volcanism, rapid uplift, and intense seismicity.

In membrane electrode assembly, Cu-Pd SAA delivers a 90.1% ethylene FE and ~100 % conversion at −2.5 A (−0.1 A cm−2), along with 500 h stability for crude ethylene purification. Combined in-situ spectroscopy and DFT calculation reveal that the catalyst facilitates the direct hydrogenation of acetylene via Pd-H species rather than hydrogen spillover. This mechanism concurrently lowers the EAE energy barrier and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides insights for designing high-efficiency electrocatalysts for hydrogenation electrosynthesis. The electrochemical semi-hydrogenation of C₂H₂ to C₂H₂ is a promising process, but the competing hydrogen evolution reaction remains a major obstacle. This work presents a novel catalytic strategy to steer active hydrogen species, thereby improving the Faradaic efficiency for ethylene.

&lt;p&gt;Electroconversion of acetylene towards polymer-grade ethylene (EAE) is recognized as a promising substitution for thermo-catalytic route.

Drylands, which cover nearly half of Earth’s land, have limited forest establishment, and factors influencing mycorrhization in these stressful environments remain unclear. Here, we integrate large-scale field surveys along aridity gradients with greenhouse experiments and over 33,000 microscopic mycorrhizal observations, revealing that aridity significantly enhances mycorrhization. Mycorrhizal fungi undergo niche modification, whereby facilitative microbial interactions promote mycorrhization under aridity stress. We identify a core synthetic microbial community linked to mycorrhization and provide mechanistic evidence that this community facilitates mycorrhization through physical attachment to fungal hyphae and by alleviating soil metabolite inhibition that otherwise suppresses mycorrhization under arid conditions. In this work, our findings highlight the role of microbial interkingdom interactions in driving tree mycorrhizal colonization in arid regions, offering critical insights for guiding tree planting and restoration efforts in drylands. Tree ectomycorrhizal colonization in aridity regions is supported by microbial cooperation, where bacteria attach to fungal hyphae and reduce inhibitory soil metabolites, suggesting a microbiome-based strategy for tree restoration.

&lt;p&gt;Mycorrhizal fungi serve as fundamental agents in forest establishment and progression, underpinning critical ecosystem functions through symbiotic root associations. Drylands, which cover nearly half of Earth’s land, have limited forest establishment, and factors influencing mycorrhization in these stressful environments remain unclear. Here, we integrate large-scale field surveys along aridity gradients with greenhouse experiments and over 33,000 microscopic mycorrhizal observations, revealing that aridity significantly enhances mycorrhization. Mycorrhizal fungi undergo niche modification, whereby facilitative microbial interactions promote mycorrhization under aridity stress. We identify a core synthetic microbial community linked to mycorrhization and provide mechanistic evidence that this community facilitates mycorrhization through physical attachment to fungal hyphae and by alleviating soil metabolite inhibition that otherwise suppresses mycorrhization under arid conditions. In this work, our findings highlight the role of microbial interkingdom interactions in driving tree mycorrhizal colonization in arid regions, offering critical insights for guiding tree planting and restoration efforts in drylands. Tree ectomycorrhizal colonization in aridity regions is supported by microbial cooperation, where bacteria attach to fungal hyphae and reduce inhibitory soil metabolites, suggesting a microbiome-based strategy for tree restoration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Real-time observation of the diffusion-limited formation of a cation-molecule complex</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-68008-5</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-68008-5</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:52:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jeppe K.
