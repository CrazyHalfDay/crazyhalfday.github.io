These results indicate that the voluminous Triassic felsic−mafic rocks, which served as the basement for the entire Mesozoic Lanping Basin and rolled into the Cenozoic fold-thrust belt, have undergone large-scale fluid-rock reactions with the regional basin brines, providing a plentiful supply of Zn-Pb metals for regional Mississippi Valley−type deposits. In contrast, Cenozoic high-K plutons may intrude into more restricted spatial domains and might have undergone smaller-scale fluid-rock interactions, providing less Zn-Pb metals. This explains why a world-class Zn-Pb deposit formed at Jinding, while only small-scale Zn-Pb deposits developed at the Baiyangping ore district. This study illustrates that metal sources for Mississippi Valley−type Zn-Pb mineralization commonly display composite provenance characteristics, integrating contributions from sedimentary successions and basement rocks. In addition, it underscores the importance of metal release through interactions between fluids and magmatic rocks for the formation of large-scale Zn-Pb mineralization and demonstrates the utility of Pb isotope model ages in evaluating metal sources.

Cathodoluminescence imaging, electron backscatter diffraction, electron probe microanalysis, and in situ laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry trace element data were combined to assess apatite growth histories and post-crystallization modifications.

In lower amphibolite-facies rocks, apatite is characterized by core-mantle structures, weak SPO, but CPO subparallel to stretching lineation, and variable trace element patterns, consistent with episodic growth during fluid-mediated dissolution–precipitation under retrograde conditions. Systematic variations in apatite chemistry—including decreasing Sr/Y, ΣLREE, and (La/Yb)N, and increasing Th/U and F/Cl with decreasing metamorphic grade—reflect the influence of metamorphic fluid composition, mineral reaction pathways, and elemental partition among mineral phases at corresponding metamorphic conditions. Despite differences in deformation and growth history, consistent correlations between texture and composition suggest localized, short-range fluid-mediated element redistribution.

The tectonic setting of the Jiao-Liao-Ji belt in the eastern North China Craton remains debated due to multistage Precambrian overprinting, but resolving this issue is critical for reconstructing the North China Craton’s Precambrian evolution and its role in the Columbia supercontinent. Here, we report new laser ablation−inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb ages of 1.86−1.82 Ga (zircon) and 1.89−1.86 Ga (titanite), together with geochemical data, for mafic dikes intruding Neoarchean−Paleoproterozoic strata of the Jiaodong Terrane in the southern Jiao-Liao-Ji belt. The dikes display moderate light rare earth element enrichment, low Nb/La ratios, and variable εNd(t) values (−8.99 to +5.89). Based on trace-element systematics and intrusion ages, the dikes can be divided into two groups. Group I dikes (ca. 1.86 Ga) show higher Mg# and Nb/La ratios, lower Th/Nb and (La/Yb)N values, and more positive εNd(t) values (up to +5.89) than Group II dikes (ca. 1.82 Ga). Both groups were derived from a metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), but their contrasting geochemical signatures reflect preexisting mantle heterogeneity, involving both depleted and enriched SCLM domains and variable melting degrees. Together with coeval A-type granites, alkaline rocks, and associated carbonate-clastic assemblages, the mafic dikes point to an intracontinental rift setting. These results suggest that the Jiao-Liao-Ji belt underwent intracontinental extension during the Paleoproterozoic, likely linked to the collapse of the Trans−North China orogen and the initial breakup of the Columbia supercontinent.

&lt;p&gt;Mafic dikes in cratonic regions record extensional tectonic processes within the continental lithosphere and thus provide key insights into mantle−crust interaction and deep-mantle geodynamics at regional to global scales. The tectonic setting of the Jiao-Liao-Ji belt in the eastern North China Craton remains debated due to multistage Precambrian overprinting, but resolving this issue is critical for reconstructing the North China Craton’s Precambrian evolution and its role in the Columbia supercontinent. Here, we report new laser ablation−inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb ages of 1.86−1.82 Ga (zircon) and 1.89−1.86 Ga (titanite), together with geochemical data, for mafic dikes intruding Neoarchean−Paleoproterozoic strata of the Jiaodong Terrane in the southern Jiao-Liao-Ji belt. The dikes display moderate light rare earth element enrichment, low Nb/La ratios, and variable εNd(t) values (−8.99 to +5.89). Based on trace-element systematics and intrusion ages, the dikes can be divided into two groups. Group I dikes (ca. 1.86 Ga) show higher Mg# and Nb/La ratios, lower Th/Nb and (La/Yb)N values, and more positive εNd(t) values (up to +5.89) than Group II dikes (ca. 1.82 Ga). Both groups were derived from a metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), but their contrasting geochemical signatures reflect preexisting mantle heterogeneity, involving both depleted and enriched SCLM domains and variable melting degrees. Together with coeval A-type granites, alkaline rocks, and associated carbonate-clastic assemblages, the mafic dikes point to an intracontinental rift setting. These results suggest that the Jiao-Liao-Ji belt underwent intracontinental extension during the Paleoproterozoic, likely linked to the collapse of the Trans−North China orogen and the initial breakup of the Columbia supercontinent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Decoding Metamorphic Nanodiamonds Formation Through Their Internal Structures</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1111/jmg.70032</link><guid>10.1111/jmg.70032</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 06:46:07 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Tim Sotelšek</dc:creator><dc:creator>Marian Janák</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sašo Šturm</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sorour Semsari Parapari</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nik Gračanin</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kristian Radan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mehmet Ali Gülgün</dc:creator><dc:creator>Stanislava Milovská</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mirijam Vrabec</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Journal of Metamorphic Geology</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1111/jmg.70032</prism:doi><description>ABSTRACT Metamorphic diamonds offer insights into Earth's evolution, modulating the global carbon cycle through subduction into the mantle and exhumation.

The fluids exhibit exceptionally high CH 4 concentrations, that exceed those at the Guaymas Basin, and display characteristics typical of sediment-hosted hydrothermal systems, indicating thermal decomposition of organic matter in clastic sediments.

Thermodynamic modeling suggests that these high H 2 /H 2 S ratios may result solely from degradation of organic matter followed by abiotic CH 4 oxidation at ~400 °C, rather than from reactions with ultramafic rocks.

The chemistry of contemporaneous marine carbonates provides a window into operation of the carbon cycle across this transition. Specifically, carbonate rocks co-eval with the GOE preserve a large and long-lived positive carbon isotope ( δ 13 C) excursion, the Lomagundi–Jatuli excursion (LJE), that canonically is interpreted as an increase in organic matter burial linked to the oxygenation of Earth’s surface. However, the cause, synchroneity, and global nature of the LJE remain contentious due to significant uncertainties in the excursion’s timing and magnitude. These uncertainties stem from the incomplete, time-uncertain, and spatially variable nature of the shallow-water sedimentary record. Here, we use Bayesian inference to reconstruct Paleoproterozoic δ 13 C from globally distributed stratigraphic observations. Our inference reaffirms that the LJE is a global excursion, although its expression varies locally, and provides revised estimates for its timing and magnitude. We find that δ 13 C most likely began to increase at 2,445 Ma, subsequently returning to baseline values at 2,018 Ma. The most likely excursion peak occurs at 2,130 Ma, and it is very unlikely (5% probability) that peak δ 13 C values exceeded 9.1 ‰ . Altogether, our results indicate the LJE has an earlier onset, longer duration, and lower magnitude than previously thought. The initial δ 13 C increase occurs before or contemporaneously with both the earliest rise of atmospheric O 2 and Paleoproterozoic “snowball” glaciations, hinting at a mechanistic link among the LJE, the GOE, and climate.

&lt;p&gt;Many of the outer Solar System’s icy satellites feature known or suspected subsurface oceans, at least some of which are likely situated atop rocky interiors. Water–rock interactions at and beneath these seafloors might support active chemoautotrophic habitats, with subseafloor fluid flow facilitated by active faulting and hydrothermal systems. Absent such phenomena, however, any attainment of chemical equilibrium between the seafloor and ocean might limit the availability of chemical energy for life.

The difference in rupture speed between fault segments in the 2023 Mw 7.8 Kahramanmaraş earthquake may be explained by the contrasting structure of and stress on these segments, according to seismic tomographic imaging of beneath the fault zone.

Here, we develop a field-effect passivation strategy by introducing a low-work-function Ta2O5 dielectric layer between the CdS and Sb2(S,Se)3 layers. This Ta2O5 layer serves as an optimal substrate for growing highly crystalline Sb2(S,Se)3 films while also enhancing interfacial charge transport. The positive fixed charges in Ta2O5 strengthen the built-in electric field and promotes electrons extraction while suppressing holes accumulation at the interface, thereby substantially suppressing non-radiative recombination probabilities. Implementing this passivation strategy yields a record PCE of 10.95% (10.65% certified) an VOC of 695 mV, corresponding to a remarkably low voltage deficit. This work establishes a universal physical passivation paradigm for interface quality optimization and VOC loss mitigation in high-performance Sb2(S,Se)3 photovoltaics. The inferior heterojunction quality and misaligned energy levels at the buffer/absorber layer hinders development of antimony selenosulfide solar cells. Here, authors introduce low-work-function tantalum pentoxide dielectric layer for field-effect passivation, achieving device efficiency of 10.95%.

&lt;p&gt;The inferior heterojunction quality and misaligned energy levels at the buffer/absorber interface cause severe interface recombination and large open-circuit voltage (VOC) loss, limiting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) solar cells. Here, we develop a field-effect passivation strategy by introducing a low-work-function Ta2O5 dielectric layer between the CdS and Sb2(S,Se)3 layers. This Ta2O5 layer serves as an optimal substrate for growing highly crystalline Sb2(S,Se)3 films while also enhancing interfacial charge transport. The positive fixed charges in Ta2O5 strengthen the built-in electric field and promotes electrons extraction while suppressing holes accumulation at the interface, thereby substantially suppressing non-radiative recombination probabilities. Implementing this passivation strategy yields a record PCE of 10.95% (10.65% certified) an VOC of 695 mV, corresponding to a remarkably low voltage deficit. This work establishes a universal physical passivation paradigm for interface quality optimization and VOC loss mitigation in high-performance Sb2(S,Se)3 photovoltaics. The inferior heterojunction quality and misaligned energy levels at the buffer/absorber layer hinders development of antimony selenosulfide solar cells. Here, authors introduce low-work-function tantalum pentoxide dielectric layer for field-effect passivation, achieving device efficiency of 10.95%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in α-RuCl3/graphene heterostructure</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-68072-x</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-68072-x</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:42:51 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Soyun Kim</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jo Hyun Yun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Junsik Choe</dc:creator><dc:creator>Dohun Kim</dc:creator><dc:creator>Takashi Taniguchi</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kenji Watanabe</dc:creator><dc:creator>Joseph Falson</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jun Sung Kim</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kyung-Hwan Jin</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gil Young Cho</dc:creator><dc:creator>Youngwook Kim</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-68072-x</prism:doi><description>We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/α-RuCl3alpha-RuCl3 heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier.

Here we report an electron-backscatter-diffraction-based imaging method to quantify lattice strain evolution and its spatial heterogeneity in two technologically important layered oxide cathodes (i.e. positive electrodes). Quantitative analysis is achieved by examining numerical distribution of the crystal misorientation data from thousands of positive electrode particles, which follows a positively skewed distribution. We reveal pronounced lattice strain heterogeneities both within individual grains and across different particles. These strain variations self-heal during relithiation but intensify with deeper delithiation and repeated cycling. The increased strain impedes Li-ion bulk diffusion, thereby limiting the maximum accessible capacity, especially at high current densities. Three-dimensional pole-figure analysis further identifies layer bending and layer twisting as the two major lattice distortion modes in the electrochemically cycled positive electrode particles. The accumulation of the unrecoverable layer bending governs the kinetically controlled capacity loss in the layered oxide positive electrodes. Lattice strain impacts battery cathode performance and cycle life. Here, authors visualize and quantify strain in layered oxides through electron backscatter diffraction imaging, revealing heterogeneous, cycle-dependent distortions that slow Li transport and limit capacity, with irreversible layer bending driving capacity fade.

&lt;p&gt;Lattice strain critically affects electrochemical performance and durability of battery electrode materials. Here we report an electron-backscatter-diffraction-based imaging method to quantify lattice strain evolution and its spatial heterogeneity in two technologically important layered oxide cathodes (i.e. positive electrodes). Quantitative analysis is achieved by examining numerical distribution of the crystal misorientation data from thousands of positive electrode particles, which follows a positively skewed distribution. We reveal pronounced lattice strain heterogeneities both within individual grains and across different particles. These strain variations self-heal during relithiation but intensify with deeper delithiation and repeated cycling. The increased strain impedes Li-ion bulk diffusion, thereby limiting the maximum accessible capacity, especially at high current densities. Three-dimensional pole-figure analysis further identifies layer bending and layer twisting as the two major lattice distortion modes in the electrochemically cycled positive electrode particles. The accumulation of the unrecoverable layer bending governs the kinetically controlled capacity loss in the layered oxide positive electrodes. Lattice strain impacts battery cathode performance and cycle life. Here, authors visualize and quantify strain in layered oxides through electron backscatter diffraction imaging, revealing heterogeneous, cycle-dependent distortions that slow Li transport and limit capacity, with irreversible layer bending driving capacity fade.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Harnessing strengthening-metastability synergy for extreme work hardening in additively manufactured titanium alloys</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67683-8</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-67683-8</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:04:14 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Xuliang Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Youneng Xie</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tianlong Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhihao Jiang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiangren Bai</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shun Xu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jian Lu</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-67683-8</prism:doi><description>Rapid bottom-up fabrication via additive manufacturing (AM) unlocks unprecedented design freedom for geometrically complex and lightweight titanium (Ti) alloys, a critical material for next-generation aerospace systems and 3C (computer, communication and consumer electronics) products.
