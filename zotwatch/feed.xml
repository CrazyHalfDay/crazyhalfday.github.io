Here, we present whole-rock geochemical and Ba–Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic data for basalts from the sediment-rich Luzon Arc and the sediment-poor Bicol Arc to constrain the recycling processes of fluid mobile elements (FME) in different subduction settings. Our results suggest that the mantle wedge beneath the Luzon and Bicol arcs was primarily metasomatized by melts from subducted sediments and fluids from subducted oceanic crust, respectively. The basalts from both arcs show variable δ 138/134 Ba values despite their limited variations in Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopes, reflecting the heterogeneous dehydration of phengite in subducted sediments and oceanic crust, which have undergone different extents of Ba isotopic fractionation at shallow depths. Luzon back-arc basalts (BAB) exhibit Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic compositions similar to those of island arc basalts (IAB), yet possess more variable and lighter Ba isotopic compositions. This defines a distinct Ba isotopic lightening trend across the arc, reflecting progressive Ba isotopic fractionation associated with enhanced phengite dehydration at increasing subduction depths. The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts. We propose that subducted oceanic crust plays a role similar to that of subducted sediments in recycling FME, such as K, Rb, and Ba, owing to the buffering effect of phengite. Nevertheless, it potentially contributes more significantly to Sr enrichment within the mantle wedge of subduction zones.

This study investigates the Mo isotope compositions of mafic granulite and websterite xenoliths derived from Mesozoic basalts in the western Cathaysia Block to directly constrain the mechanisms underlying Mo isotope variations in the juvenile lower continental crust. Xenoliths with high Mo concentrations show mantle-like δ 98/95 Mo (−0.18 ‰), whereas those with low Mo concentrations display significant variation in δ 98/95 Mo values (−1.94 ‰ to 0.55 ‰). This significant variation cannot be fully explained by mantle heterogeneity, as supported by Sr Nd isotopes with limited variability and low Nb/Zr, (La/Sm) N , and Th/Yb ratios. The lack of covariance between δ 98/95 Mo and differentiation index Mg# argues against magmatic differentiation governing Mo isotopic fractionation. Most samples show a sharp decline in δ 98/95 Mo values with decreasing Mo/Ce ratios, far below mantle values, suggesting that fluid leaching is responsible for the observed Mo isotope fractionation. Based on newly obtained Mo isotope data for these Mesozoic xenoliths, the juvenile lower crust beneath the Cathaysia Block is enriched in extremely light Mo isotopes compared to the mantle. It is proposed that widely distributed fluids in the crust may be an important reservoir for balancing Earth's Mo isotope system. In this context, molybdenum isotope fingerprinting of fluid activities constitutes a significant approach for investigating crustal differentiation.

Taken together, our results underscore the profound link between earthquake occurrence and the large-scale, long-term dynamics of mantle flow and subduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Two episodes of ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism within one orogenic cycle</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2026.119887</link><guid>10.1016/j.epsl.2026.119887</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 23:18:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jie Dong</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chunjing Wei</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shuguang Song</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guochun Zhao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guibin Zhang</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1016/j.epsl.2026.119887</prism:doi><description>Ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism (UHTM) is significant for constraining the thermal-mechanical evolution of continental crust, which can periodically occur within one orogenic cycle involving subduction, collision and subsequent extension stages.

The CDR process is triggered by oxidation of the mineralizing fluids, consistent with the decreasing δ 34 S values from Py2r to Py3. Combined with higher Co-Ni concentrations in Py3 (similar to Py2c) relative to Py2r, we infer that fluid oxidation is associated with hydraulic fracturing restart. Multiple sulfur isotopes (δ 34 S: −4.92 to 0.45‰; Δ 33 S: −0.05 ± 0.10‰) and low Co-Ni and high Se contents of pyrite suggest a magmatic fluid origin from a possible concealed intrusion.

However, the petrogenesis of hornblende-rich cumulates in the deep crust and their significant role in arc crustal evolution remains unclear. In this contribution, we focus on Late Jurassic mafic-ultramafic intrusive rocks from the Zedong terrane (central-eastern Gangdese area, South Tibet) and use detailed petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data to determine the origin of hornblende-rich cumulates with textural and chemical heterogeneities. The clinopyroxene (Cpx) hornblendite with adcumulate texture contains three distinct types of amphibole (cumulus, poikilitic, and minor interstitial). These amphiboles display homogeneous major and trace element compositions, consistent with crystallization from a liquid of constant composition. Rock fabric analysis further suggests that they formed by in-situ nucleation and overgrowth at the interface between the mush layer and the convecting parental magma within the magma reservoir. Type I hornblende (Hb) gabbros have an orthocumulate texture with the lowest whole-rock MgO and Mg# values. Intercumulus melt evolution revealed by mineral assemblage and compositional variations indicate that Type I gabbros formed through a peritectic reaction between clinopyroxene precursors and evolved interstitial melts, followed by melt migration and fluid exsolution in a semi-open system. Type II gabbros have the highest whole-rock MgO and Mg# values and are characterized by extensive disequilibrium features. Geochemical modeling indicates that their formation entails a melt-flushing process involving the upward percolation of deep-recharge melts through the crystal mush. This study provides petrological evidence for the multiple origins of hornblende-rich cumulates within a common middle-lower crustal magma reservoir. Their textural and chemical heterogeneities may reflect spatial variations in crystallization regimes across distinct reservoir domains. The Zedong hornblende-rich cumulates have more depleted whole-rock Sr–Nd isotopic compositions and zircon εHf(t) values than those cumulates from Early Jurassic and Cretaceous Gangdess arc. This indicates that their parental magma was derived from a more juvenile mantle wedge and records significant growth in the middle-lower crust. The Cpx hornblendite has lowest concentrations of SiO2 but highest Fe2O3T and (Dy/Yb)N ratios. The differentiation trends between the cumulate rocks and coeval non-cumulate rocks within the Zedong terrane indicate that the evolution of the Late Jurassic arc crust was mainly controlled by amphibole fractionation. Modeling shows that melts in equilibrium with the cumulus and brown amphiboles are compositionally analogous to coeval intermediate-acid rocks, and imply the existence of a trans-crustal magma plumbing system in this arc.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Early fractionation of amphibole is an essential process in the evolution of hydrous sub-arc mantle-derived magmas. However, the petrogenesis of hornblende-rich cumulates in the deep crust and their significant role in arc crustal evolution remains unclear. In this contribution, we focus on Late Jurassic mafic-ultramafic intrusive rocks from the Zedong terrane (central-eastern Gangdese area, South Tibet) and use detailed petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data to determine the origin of hornblende-rich cumulates with textural and chemical heterogeneities. The clinopyroxene (Cpx) hornblendite with adcumulate texture contains three distinct types of amphibole (cumulus, poikilitic, and minor interstitial). These amphiboles display homogeneous major and trace element compositions, consistent with crystallization from a liquid of constant composition. Rock fabric analysis further suggests that they formed by in-situ nucleation and overgrowth at the interface between the mush layer and the convecting parental magma within the magma reservoir. Type I hornblende (Hb) gabbros have an orthocumulate texture with the lowest whole-rock MgO and Mg# values. Intercumulus melt evolution revealed by mineral assemblage and compositional variations indicate that Type I gabbros formed through a peritectic reaction between clinopyroxene precursors and evolved interstitial melts, followed by melt migration and fluid exsolution in a semi-open system. Type II gabbros have the highest whole-rock MgO and Mg# values and are characterized by extensive disequilibrium features. Geochemical modeling indicates that their formation entails a melt-flushing process involving the upward percolation of deep-recharge melts through the crystal mush. This study provides petrological evidence for the multiple origins of hornblende-rich cumulates within a common middle-lower crustal magma reservoir. Their textural and chemical heterogeneities may reflect spatial variations in crystallization regimes across distinct reservoir domains. The Zedong hornblende-rich cumulates have more depleted whole-rock Sr–Nd isotopic compositions and zircon εHf(t) values than those cumulates from Early Jurassic and Cretaceous Gangdess arc. This indicates that their parental magma was derived from a more juvenile mantle wedge and records significant growth in the middle-lower crust. The Cpx hornblendite has lowest concentrations of SiO2 but highest Fe2O3T and (Dy/Yb)N ratios. The differentiation trends between the cumulate rocks and coeval non-cumulate rocks within the Zedong terrane indicate that the evolution of the Late Jurassic arc crust was mainly controlled by amphibole fractionation. Modeling shows that melts in equilibrium with the cumulus and brown amphiboles are compositionally analogous to coeval intermediate-acid rocks, and imply the existence of a trans-crustal magma plumbing system in this arc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Mineralization processes for sphalerite in MVT deposits: Insights from the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang ore field, Guizhou, Southwest China</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs2025-125</link><guid>10.1144/jgs2025-125</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:01:17 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Weijun He</dc:creator><dc:creator>Youguo Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sigen Ma</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Journal of the Geological Society</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1144/jgs2025-125</prism:doi><description>Although Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposit mineralization processes are well characterized, the associated ore-forming fluids, which are crucial to understanding Pb and Zn mineralization, should be investigated further. With more than 0.7 million tonnes (Mt) of Zn reserves at average grades ranging from 4–8%, the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field comprises representative deposits such as those of Caiyuanhe, Heli, and Qingshuitang. The ore bodies, which exhibit stratiform, vein-like, and lenticular forms, are hosted within the Cambrian Qingxudong Formation dolomite and are spatially associated with the NE-trending Mandong fault. This Zn ore field in Southwest China is a classic example of Zn-rich mineralization. However, the genetic mechanisms and processes responsible for the Zn-rich nature of these MVT Pb‒Zn deposits remain poorly understood. This study aims to characterize Zn mineralization in the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field, Southwest China. The rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol2) from the syn-ore stage vary between 5.63 and 32.50 ppm (with an average of 14.07 ppm), whereas in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol3) from post-ore stage, the values range from 45.63 to 95.69 ppm (with an average of 72.03 ppm). The fluid inclusions of Dol2 and Dol3 exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 98–204°C (with an average of 143°C) and 98–195°C (with an average of 132°C), with corresponding salinity ranges of 13.0–29.5 wt% (with an average of 20.9 wt%) and 16.0–25.7 wt% (with an average of 18.9 wt%) NaCl equivalent, respectively. Sphalerite inclusions exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 95–230°C (with a mean of 143°C) and salinities ranging from 13.8–28.9 wt% (with a mean of 23.7 wt%) NaCl. The δ 13 C fluid , δ D fluid , and δ 18 O fluid values of the ore-forming fluids range from -4.4‰ to -3.8‰ (with a mean of -4.1‰), -36.4‰ to -27.8‰ (with a mean of -31.9‰), and 4.9‰ to 5.7‰ (with a mean of 5.3‰), respectively. In this study, an Fe- and Zn-enriched NaCl-H₂O basement brine is identified as the ore-forming fluid responsible for the Zn-rich MVT deposits. During its low- to medium-temperature migration, the fluid was channelled by the Mandong fault and Wangsi anticline structural framework, which provided ideal pathways and traps. During migration, the fluid leached sulfur (reduced from evaporites to H 2 S) from wall rocks and ultimately precipitated within dolomite faults and fractures. The distinct Zn-rich character of the deposits stems from the following two key factors: a primary derivation from the Zn-rich basement of the Yangtze Block and a chemical preference for Zn enrichment, which is driven by the differing fractionation coefficients of Zn- and Pb-chloride complexes in the NaCl–H 2 O system. This study advances the understanding of the genesis of MVT deposits worldwide.

The low- δ ¹⁸O granites were formed through partial melting of juvenile lower gabbroic crust that had been interpointed by high-temperature hydrothermal alteration. The high Ba-Sr granitoids share geochemical affinity with Archean sanukitoids, forming via amphibole-dominated fractional crystallization of fluid-metasomatized mantle.

Higher reported R S/P values for smaller ULVZs near subduction zones may therefore indicate different processes at play controlling ULVZ formation across the diverse core-mantle boundary landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Reactivation of basement faults by deep fluids during the 2017 Changdao earthquake swarm, Eastern China</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-026-03228-1</link><guid>10.1038/s43247-026-03228-1</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:57:50 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Peng Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Baoshan Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhigang Peng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xinglin Lei</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Communications Earth &amp;amp; Environment</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s43247-026-03228-1</prism:doi><description>Ancient basement faults within plate interiors may be reactivated by external forces, generating intraplate seismicity.

The Ti isotope systematics of volcanic island arc systems have been used as a model for the formation of continental crust, however, the behavior of Ti isotopes of rocks and minerals in continental arcs and plutonic differentiation sequences has not yet been closely examined. The behavior of Ti isotopes in plutonic systems may deviate from volcanic systems due to distinct mineral assemblages and differentiation histories. Consequently, island arcs may fail to capture the full spectrum of Ti isotope variability linked to the processes that generate and differentiate crust in continental arc systems. To test this hypothesis, we conducted Ti isotope measurements of five whole rocks which lie in the compositional range of 50 to 75 wt% SiO 2 and their Ti-bearing minerals (titanite, biotite, hornblende, magnetite) from the geochemically well-characterized calc-alkaline Tuolumne Intrusive Complex in eastern California, USA. The whole rock samples yield δ 49 Ti values that increase from +0.033 ± 0.030 ‰ (95 % CI) to +0.619 ± 0.025 ‰ (95 % CI). Titanite and magnetite mineral separates yield δ 49 Ti values that are up to 0.37 ‰ lower than the whole rock, while biotite and hornblende yield δ 49 Ti values that are within uncertainty of, or up to 0.25 ‰ higher than the whole rock. Inter-mineral Ti isotope fractionation reveals that titanite may fractionate Ti isotopes to an extent comparable with magnetite, whereas biotite and hornblende preferentially incorporate isotopically heavy Ti. The high f O 2 and f H 2 O conditions characteristic of continental arcs can favor titanite over Fe-Ti oxides as the primary host of Ti and the fractional crystallization of the former is interpreted to be the primary driver of Ti isotope fractionation in the Tuolumne magmas. However, the petrographic relationships between titanite and other Ti-bearing phases indicates that re-equilibration of Ti among minerals in long-lived plutonic systems can lead to complex Ti isotope fractionation mechanisms. Our data shows that Ti removal and fractionation imparted by mineral crystallization for the Tuolumne system can be described with a net fractionation factor of −0.18 ‰, which is congruous with calc-alkaline island arcs, despite the observation that Ti fractionation here is controlled by a different Ti phase. This investigation may provide insights into the Ti isotope systematics of ancient continental crust, where complete differentiation sequences are absent, thereby improving our ability to interpret such data

The processes governing melt transport from the arc to the back-arc spreading center remain enigmatic, particularly beneath slow-spreading systems with limited melt volumes, where imaging of small-scale structures has been challenging. Here, we use multimode Rayleigh-wave tomography, enhanced by increased raypath coverage through both two- and three-station interferometry, to resolve S-wave velocity structure down to ∼100 km depth beneath the central Mariana subduction zone. Our model reveals a triangle-like low-velocity anomaly at 15−30 km depth beneath the Mariana trough and an elliptical low-velocity anomaly at 50−90 km depth beneath the Mariana arc, both consistent with melt equilibration depths from thermobarometry. Additionally, a cylindrical low-velocity anomaly extends from the base of the triangle-like low-velocity anomaly to ∼80 km depth and appears weakly connected to the anomaly beneath the arc. We interpret this feature as diapiric upwelling that links melt sources beneath the arc and back-arc.

Our model reveals a triangle-like low-velocity anomaly at 15−30 km depth beneath the Mariana trough and an elliptical low-velocity anomaly at 50−90 km depth beneath the Mariana arc, both consistent with melt equilibration depths from thermobarometry. Additionally, a cylindrical low-velocity anomaly extends from the base of the triangle-like low-velocity anomaly to ∼80 km depth and appears weakly connected to the anomaly beneath the arc. We interpret this feature as diapiric upwelling that links melt sources beneath the arc and back-arc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Coupled lithospheric, topographic, and environmental changes driven by variations in subduction angles of the Paleo-Pacific plate</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1130/b38643.1</link><guid>10.1130/b38643.1</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:02:02 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Xiuquan Miao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yunying Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wen Yan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiaolong Huang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhen Sun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhongxian Zhao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chan Wang</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Geological Society of America Bulletin</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1130/b38643.1</prism:doi><description>Continental lithospheric evolution controls the surface topography, environment, and biosphere.
