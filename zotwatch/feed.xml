Here we reconstruct silicate weathering fluxes over the past 700,000 years by combining the global geochemical numerical model GEOCLIM with machine learning algorithms to constrain silicate weathering history in the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone. Our results show that during glacial periods, weathering fluxes peaked at approximately 1.86 × 1012 moles per year, drawing down about 9.3 ppmv of carbon dioxide. Exposure of continental shelves during low sea levels raised glacial weathering by 33%, but high-frequency positive rainfall anomalies amplified this increase by 54–130% (approximately 9.2–13.7 ppmv carbon dioxide). This underscores how sea-level change and hydrology control tropical shelf weathering. Our study provides critical insights into past climatic transitions, emphasizing the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone’s role in regulating the global carbon cycle and offering constraints for future climate projections. During glacial periods, silicate weathering fluxes in the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone were 33% higher compared to interglacial periods, with rainfalls amplifying it to 54–130%, according to numerical simulation of silicate chemical weathering.

&lt;p&gt;The Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone is a key carbon sink via silicate weathering, yet its glacial-interglacial carbon dioxide consumption remains unclear. Here we reconstruct silicate weathering fluxes over the past 700,000 years by combining the global geochemical numerical model GEOCLIM with machine learning algorithms to constrain silicate weathering history in the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone. Our results show that during glacial periods, weathering fluxes peaked at approximately 1.86 × 1012 moles per year, drawing down about 9.3 ppmv of carbon dioxide. Exposure of continental shelves during low sea levels raised glacial weathering by 33%, but high-frequency positive rainfall anomalies amplified this increase by 54–130% (approximately 9.2–13.7 ppmv carbon dioxide). This underscores how sea-level change and hydrology control tropical shelf weathering. Our study provides critical insights into past climatic transitions, emphasizing the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone’s role in regulating the global carbon cycle and offering constraints for future climate projections. During glacial periods, silicate weathering fluxes in the Indo-Pacific Convergence Zone were 33% higher compared to interglacial periods, with rainfalls amplifying it to 54–130%, according to numerical simulation of silicate chemical weathering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Tracing anatexis and bottom-up crustal homogenisation with in situ Sm-Nd isotopes</title><link>https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.2602</link><guid>10.7185/geochemlet.2602</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:31:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>T.

The data are integrated with ∼3461 geochemical datasets for ca. 265−200 Ma counterpart rocks from the ESCB. The studied rocks originated from a metasomatized lithospheric mantle. All data reveal that the flat subduction of the PPP transitioned from a high-angle subduction. During this transition, the ESCB lithosphere underwent sequential thinning (ca. 265−254 Ma), thickening (ca. 253−241 Ma), and thinning (ca. 240−200 Ma), driven by lithospheric extension, compression, and mechanical erosion, respectively. The high magma migration rates (&amp;gt;42 km/m.y.) during ca. 253−235 Ma indicate a rapid trench-ward movement of the ESCB, which, together with lithospheric thickening, probably facilitated the formation of flat-slab subduction. In addition, the reconstructed paleo-elevation patterns correlate well with the variations in lithospheric thickness of the ESCB. Correspondingly, the reduced and enhanced continental weathering was controlled by elevation lowering and rising during the Late Permian and Early Triassic, respectively, and our study shows that the elevation-controlled variable weathering rates may cause decreases and increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These findings elucidate the feedback mechanisms linking tectonism, lithosphere, topography, and environment.

&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectric charged domain walls (CDWs) with nanoscale thickness and bound charges are typically viewed as ultrathin, reconfigurable, and highly conductive two-dimensional components for domain wall nanoelectronics. Dimensional confinement of such polar topological structures has the potential to increase device density and unlock novel functionalities. We report 180° head-to-head and tail-to-tail CDWs exhibiting one-dimensional (1D) characteristics.

We monitored intact soil columns under natural rainfall at high temporal resolution, jointly measuring seepage flux and the hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of drainage water. The data reveal a robust, threshold-like pattern: faster seepage is consistently associated with more isotopically depleted drainage, behavior that is not readily explained by evaporation or simple mixing alone. We interpret this pattern as evidence for an interfacial hydrodynamic isotope fractionation process, in which transport dynamics and soil–water interfacial interactions partition water isotopologues without phase change. This framework refines how isotopes are used to infer soil water mixing and has implications for predicting recharge and ecosystem water use under a changing climate.
