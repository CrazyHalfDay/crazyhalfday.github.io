Here, we report the first definitive example of polymetamorphism in metapelites of the Baoyintu Group, central Inner Mongolia. Our analyses included petrographic observations, phase equilibrium modelling, as well as U–Pb and Rb–Sr geochronology. Garnet–white mica schist exhibits two stages of garnet growth: an early‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (I) with epidote + phengite + quartz + rutile (I) inclusions and a late‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (II) + muscovite + quartz + ilmenite + staurolite + rutile (II) in the matrix. Phase equilibrium modelling yields pressures of 16–22 kbar and temperatures of 400°C–500°C for the early‐stage assemblage corresponding to blueschist facies metamorphism, and 6–7 kbar and ~550°C for the late‐stage assemblage corresponding to amphibolite facies metamorphism. A garnet–two mica schist contains a mineral assemblage similar to the late‐stage assemblage in garnet–white mica schist, yielding peak pressures of 4–5 kbar and temperatures of 570°C–580°C. Zircon and rutile U–Pb geochronology of the metapelite samples yielded two groups of metamorphic ages (c. 384 and c. 259–236 Ma). In situ mica Rb–Sr geochronology of the garnet‐two mica schist yielded an age of 215 Ma interpreted to record cooling after the Permian–Triassic metamorphic peak temperature. These results reveal that medium‐ and low‐dP/dT metamorphism occurred during the late Permian–early Triassic that overprinted Devonian high‐dP/dT metamorphism. Based on previous studies of magmatism in the region, we relate the two stages of metamorphism to subduction of Paleo‐Asian oceanic lithosphere (Devonian, c. 384 Ma) and back‐arc extension (Permian–Triassic, 259–236 Ma). This contribution fills a critical gap in our understanding of the tectono‐thermal transition history of subduction within the Paleo‐Asian Ocean and provides a robust framework for interpreting polymetamorphism in accretionary orogens.

&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT Understanding metamorphic overprinting is crucial for identifying transitions in tectono‐thermal regimes during orogenesis. Here, we report the first definitive example of polymetamorphism in metapelites of the Baoyintu Group, central Inner Mongolia. Our analyses included petrographic observations, phase equilibrium modelling, as well as U–Pb and Rb–Sr geochronology. Garnet–white mica schist exhibits two stages of garnet growth: an early‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (I) with epidote + phengite + quartz + rutile (I) inclusions and a late‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (II) + muscovite + quartz + ilmenite + staurolite + rutile (II) in the matrix. Phase equilibrium modelling yields pressures of 16–22 kbar and temperatures of 400°C–500°C for the early‐stage assemblage corresponding to blueschist facies metamorphism, and 6–7 kbar and ~550°C for the late‐stage assemblage corresponding to amphibolite facies metamorphism. A garnet–two mica schist contains a mineral assemblage similar to the late‐stage assemblage in garnet–white mica schist, yielding peak pressures of 4–5 kbar and temperatures of 570°C–580°C. Zircon and rutile U–Pb geochronology of the metapelite samples yielded two groups of metamorphic ages (c. 384 and c. 259–236 Ma). In situ mica Rb–Sr geochronology of the garnet‐two mica schist yielded an age of 215 Ma interpreted to record cooling after the Permian–Triassic metamorphic peak temperature. These results reveal that medium‐ and low‐dP/dT metamorphism occurred during the late Permian–early Triassic that overprinted Devonian high‐dP/dT metamorphism. Based on previous studies of magmatism in the region, we relate the two stages of metamorphism to subduction of Paleo‐Asian oceanic lithosphere (Devonian, c. 384 Ma) and back‐arc extension (Permian–Triassic, 259–236 Ma). This contribution fills a critical gap in our understanding of the tectono‐thermal transition history of subduction within the Paleo‐Asian Ocean and provides a robust framework for interpreting polymetamorphism in accretionary orogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Average benchmark compositions of intraplate basalts with continental and ocean island provenance</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2026.123292</link><guid>10.1016/j.chemgeo.2026.123292</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 17:08:16 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>David A.

Because Na2O loss through fluid exsolution during kimberlite ascent cannot exceed 0.5 wt%, the extreme Na loss leading to the observed low bulk-kimberlite values must occur upon solidification when copious amounts of Na-rich fluids are expelled. These findings suggest that kimberlitic melts do not require a peculiar mantle source, but rather carbon-bearing fertile lherzolites that melt at adiabatic conditions, placing kimberlites into a broad continuum with primitive alkaline ocean island melts.

Density contrast and plagioclase accumulation were responsible for the formation of the gabbroic anorthosites and diabases. Regional extensional tectonics of the eastern Gondwana at ca. 140 Ma could provide a channel for the lower-density plagioclase-bearing melts upwelling beneath this region. These rocks represent pioneer products of mid-oceanic-ridge magmatism of the Eastern Indian Ocean, which signify that the formation of the Eastern Indian Ocean occurred as early as 136 Ma.

Petrogenetic modeling suggests that mixing of 86% partial cumulate silicates (PCS) and 95% PCS derived from the LMO in an ~8:2 ratio best reproduces the primary mantle source of the CE-5 basalts. Trace-element modeling of pyroxene further requires incorporation of IBC material into the source region to account for the observed basalt compositions. Ilmenite grains exhibit δ49Ti values ranging from -0.09 ± 0.06‰ to +0.23 ± 0.07‰. Ilmenites with higher Mg# generally exhibit heavier Ti isotopic compositions, whereas those with lower Mg# display greater variability in δ49Ti, providing direct evidence for differential involvement of IBC-derived components in the CE-5 mantle source and explaining the elevated Ti contents of these basalts. These Ti-isotope signatures further suggest stratification within the IBC layer, in which late-stage IBC material that sank into the deeper mantle possessed heavier isotopic compositions, whereas lighter Ti was introduced during subsequent magma evolution—potentially accounting for the heavier Ti-isotope signatures observed in Apollo high-Ti basalts. Residual IBC material that failed to sink may have been preserved in the upper mantle beneath the Procellarum KREEP Terrane, potentially sustaining prolonged basaltic magmatism on the lunar nearside and contributing to the relatively young eruption ages of the CE-5 basalts.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Ilmenite-bearing cumulate (IBC), formed during the late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization, is widely considered as the principal reservoirs supplying titanium (Ti) to lunar basalts. Chang’e-5 (CE-5) basalts differ compositionally from Apollo and Luna samples and exhibit intermediate Ti contents, complicating evaluation of the ilmenite contribution to their mantle sources. Here, we present major and trace element compositions and in-situ Ti isotope measurements of ilmenite from Chang’e-5 basalts to constrain the extent of IBC involvement in their mantle regions. Petrogenetic modeling suggests that mixing of 86% partial cumulate silicates (PCS) and 95% PCS derived from the LMO in an ~8:2 ratio best reproduces the primary mantle source of the CE-5 basalts. Trace-element modeling of pyroxene further requires incorporation of IBC material into the source region to account for the observed basalt compositions. Ilmenite grains exhibit δ49Ti values ranging from -0.09 ± 0.06‰ to +0.23 ± 0.07‰.

Although these magmas are typically modified by crustal assimilation during ascent, key aspects of this process, especially the type and amount of assimilated material and the consequent effects on magma composition, remain poorly constrained, hindering a full understanding of their petrogenesis. Clinopyroxene (Cpx) serves as an ideal archive for deciphering crustal assimilation in such magmatic systems, as it crystallizes over a wide range of melt compositions and is relatively rich in elements that can be used as isotopic tracers (such as Sr). Here, we conduct detailed petrographic studies and in-situ elemental and Sr isotopic analyses along core-to-rim traverses of Cpx from a suite of coeval potassic–ultrapotassic mafic lavas and dikes sampled at six locations of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Two populations of Cpx are identified: phenocrysts and green cores interpreted as recycled crystals from differentiated progenitor magmas related to the host magmas. The phenocryst cores are characterized by high Mg# (up to 90) and elevated Ni and Cr contents, consistent with derivation from primitive mantle-derived melts. Their similarly high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, combined with trace-element systematics, suggest that the primitive melts were derived from a common, slightly enriched lithospheric mantle source metasomatized by carbonate melt-dominated agents. Cpx-based thermobarometry indicates that these magmas ascended through the crust and crystallized at depths corresponding to ~0.2–1.0 GPa, defining a transcrustal plumbing system. Normal core-to-rim zoning in Cpx phenocrysts, as shown by decreasing Mg# and Ni and Cr contents, and increasing incompatible element concentrations (e.g. rare earth elements and Zr), reflects fractional crystallization of Cpx, olivine, and/or phlogopite in the magma plumbing system. Concurrently, systematic increases in initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios from core to rim (up to 0.004) record progressive assimilation of crustal materials with high Sr isotopic ratios. The presence of Neoproterozoic zircon xenocrysts, along with Sr content and isotopic data from regional crustal rocks, identifies Neoproterozoic granitic gneiss as the most likely assimilant. Quantitative models support this interpretation and indicate assimilated wall-rock melt masses of &amp;lt;0.2. Our in-situ micro-analytical data demonstrate that even crustal assimilation to this limited extent can markedly control the isotopic signature of potassic–ultrapotassic mafic magmas in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Given that such magmas significantly contribute to crustal growth by differentiating into voluminous granitoids, this study provides critical insights into how assimilation modulates the isotopic composition of the post-collisional newly-formed crust.

In this paper, we use numerical models of continental rifting to investigate whether proximity to cratonic lithosphere enhances the ore-forming potential during rift basin evolution. Our results show that narrow asymmetric and wide rifts respond differently to the presence of close cratonic edges. The potential for metallogenesis in narrow asymmetric rifts decreases with increasing proximity to the craton edge. In contrast, metal source rock area and ore-forming mechanisms increase when wide rifts form close to a craton edge. We attribute these responses to the increased lithospheric strength on the craton-ward side of the rift that determines not only the initial fault geometry, but also the subsequent fault development and migration direction. This modifies the spatial and temporal overlap of the components of the mineral system required for deposit formation, i.e., source rock, fluid-focussing faults, and deposit host rock. The greatest metallogenic potential is found in the narrow margin of narrow asymmetric rifts formed far from a craton edge; here, the largest area of source rock is concentrated in the main border basin. The link between craton edges and metallogenic potential, therefore, is hypothesized to be due to the preferred initialization of rifts next to, and the preferential preservation of deposits on, the edges of stable cratons.

The lowest ratios, or most negative μ 182 W values when calculated as parts per million variations from an assumed Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) value, correspond with elevated 3 He/ 4 He compositions for some OIB lavas. Possible explanations for these anomalous isotopic compositions include: 1) core-mantle interaction following initial core-mantle separation or 2) early differentiation of the silicate mantle. Elevated 3 He/ 4 He in OIB originates from a less-degassed portion of the mantle, compared to the accessible upper mantle, and has been associated with a moderately depleted mantle component with long-lived radiogenic isotope characteristics intermediate to all known extreme mantle endmembers. This component has commonly been referred to as the “FOcal ZOne” or FOZO. In addition to these characteristics, FOZO has been suggested to have anomalous enrichments in the high field strength elements (HFSE) Ti, Ta, and Nb. Tungsten is a moderately siderophile element that behaves as an HFSE in the silicate Earth, and in some OIB, μ 182 W and Ti, Ta, and Nb enrichments display negative correlations. To further investigate the relation between anomalous μ 182 W, 3 He/ 4 He and Ti, Ta, and Nb enrichments in melts most closely associated with the FOZO mantle source, we analyzed basalts from three intraplate volcanic tracks, Easter-Salas y Gomez, Bowie-Kodiak, and Louisville, for μ 182 W and bulk major and trace elements. The new isotopic data for each hotspot system record μ 182 W values that are within the global range of OIB (Easter-Salas y Gomez μ 182 W = +3 to −17; Bowie-Kodiak μ 182 W = +1 to −12; and Louisville μ 182 W = −1 to −9). To test whether these compositions can be explained by the crystallization of an early basal magma ocean and subsequent long-term isolation of its crystallization products, a simple fractional crystallization model was developed. We find that nearly all isotopic and trace element compositions inferred for the FOZO component can be reproduced by the chemical fractionations produced with this model. Furthermore, the model is consistent with data for additional OIB sampled globally. Finally, our model results also indicate that the Sm/Nd ratio in the inferred FOZO reservoir may not be sufficiently modified by bridgmanite fractionation to generate resolvable μ 142 Nd anomalies in OIB (resulting from decay in the 146 Sm- 142 Nd short-lived system) relative to BSE. This is consistent with the lack of μ 142 Nd anomalies in most OIB, even where negative μ 182 W anomalies are largest. Collectively, these findings indicate that at least some of the anomalous 182 W/ 184 W compositions observed in modern OIB may plausibly originate from a differentiation product of the silicate mantle that formed within the first 60 Ma of Solar System history, and without the need for core-mantle interaction.

Atmospheric methanotroph Upland Soil Clusters γ (USCγ), responsible for this oxidation, was further assigned to three genera within the family Candidatus ( Ca .)

Nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging and the produced 13 C-PLFAs (phospholipid fatty acids) and 13 CO 2 in 13 CH 4 -fed microcosm confirmed methane as both carbon and energy sources. These methanotrophs exhibited low half-saturation constant ( K m ; 138.8 ± 15.8 ppm), high carbon assimilation efficiency (&gt;50%), and metabolic versatility, as revealed by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses. By extrapolating global distribution of Ca. Methyloligotrophaceae and comparing methane oxidation rates between caves and soil ecosystems, we conservatively estimate that subsurface karst in southwest China sequester ~0.56 Tg CH 4 annually. These findings highlight the ecological importance of karst ecosystems as a previously overlooked methane sink.

We detected increased methane oxidation rates from 2.9 ± 0.1 to 90.7 ± 4.5 ng·g −1 ·hour −1 while supplied with 2 to 500 parts per million (ppm) CH 4 to cave sediments. Atmospheric methanotroph Upland Soil Clusters γ (USCγ), responsible for this oxidation, was further assigned to three genera within the family Candidatus ( Ca .) Methyloligotrophaceae, including two previously unrecognized genera. Nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging and the produced 13 C-PLFAs (phospholipid fatty acids) and 13 CO 2 in 13 CH 4 -fed microcosm confirmed methane as both carbon and energy sources. These methanotrophs exhibited low half-saturation constant ( K m ; 138.8 ± 15.8 ppm), high carbon assimilation efficiency (&amp;gt;50%), and metabolic versatility, as revealed by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses. By extrapolating global distribution of Ca. Methyloligotrophaceae and comparing methane oxidation rates between caves and soil ecosystems, we conservatively estimate that subsurface karst in southwest China sequester ~0.56 Tg CH 4 annually. These findings highlight the ecological importance of karst ecosystems as a previously overlooked methane sink.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Metallic molybdenum sulfide catalyses protometabolic carbon dioxide reaction networks under extreme conditions</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69255-w</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-69255-w</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:04:59 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Pengfei Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xu Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Daoping He</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yiju Liao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Haozhe Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jiong Cheng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yichang Lu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ziming Yang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yang Yang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fangming Jin</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-026-69255-w</prism:doi><description>The nonenzymatic synthesis of organics from H2–CO2 redox couple forms the foundational basis for prebiotic carbon metabolism.

However, melt-mush reactions and their effect on the chemical evolution of arc magmas can be elusive and cannot be constrained when studying erupted lavas in isolation. In this study, we focus on the island of St. Vincent in the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc because (1) the composition of erupted lavas has been interpreted to reflect simple fractional crystallisation, with minimal influence of other magmatic processes, and (2) an abundance of plutonic xenoliths (erupted fragments of crystal mush) can be found within the eruptive products. Thus, we are able to compare interpretations gleaned from the chemistry of erupted lavas with new observations of the crystal mush in the same magmatic system. To this end, textural analyses were undertaken on seventeen representative plutonic xenoliths from St Vincent, and four of these samples (two olivine gabbros, two hornblende-olivine gabbros) were studied in detail via element mapping, mineral trace element analyses and geochemical modelling. The chemical, textural and mineralogical characteristics of the olivine gabbros were best explained via fractional crystallisation in the mid-upper crust (~6–18 km depth). However, the hornblende-olivine gabbros (two of seventeen samples studied) contained clear textural evidence for melt-mush reaction in the mid-upper crust. The trace element compositions of minerals such as clinopyroxene in these two samples were best reproduced via assimilation-fractional crystallisation modelling, simulating melt-mush reactions, supporting the textural evidence. Our plutonic xenoliths reveal that in addition to fractional crystallisation, cryptic (i.e. not directly recorded in lavas) melt-mush reaction processes also contribute to magma chemical evolution, particularly influencing trace elements, within the sub-volcanic plumbing system. Textural evidence for melt-mush reaction is increasingly reported in plutonic xenoliths from other active arcs and exhumed arc crustal sections, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous in mush-dominated arc plumbing systems. Melt-mush reaction therefore represents an important process contributing to arc magma and arc crust trace element chemical diversity.
