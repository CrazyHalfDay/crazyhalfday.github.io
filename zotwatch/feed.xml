&lt;p&gt;高州地区地处华南板块华夏地块西南部,位于云开地体的核心区域。本研究在高州地区开展了详细的150000地质填图工作,针对含/不含石榴子石黑云斜长片麻岩进行了地球化学分析,并对石榴黑云斜长片麻岩开展了精细的岩相学、地球化学、矿物化学分析以及相平衡模拟研究。结果显示含/不含石榴子石黑云斜长片麻岩均呈现出高SiO 2 、Al 2 O 3 ,低TiO 2 ,低Na 2 O/K 2 O、Fe 2 O T 3 /K 2 O,铕负异常,高(La/Yb) N 比值等特征,并富集Rb、Th、U而亏损Nb、Ta、Zr、Hf等高场强元素。其原岩可能为地表的一套含粘土质杂砂岩建造,夹少量的长石砂岩,属于副片麻岩。岩相学观察表明,石榴黑云斜长片麻岩经历了两个变质阶段。峰期矿物组合为石榴子石+斜长石+黑云母+钾长石+白云母+熔体+石英,退变质矿物组合为斜长石+黑云母+钾长石+白云母+石英。通过矿物成分分析和相平衡模拟,限定了峰期的温压条件为 740~750℃、1.15~1.2GPa,退变质温度条件为 P-T 轨迹和峰后降温减压的特征,表明这些岩石经历了早期地壳增厚以及随后的快速折返/隆升过程。前人年代学研究数据表明华夏地块的角闪-麻粒岩相的变质作用发生于460~400Ma。结合前人研究结果,本文表明高州地区的变质基底岩石在早古生代经历了高压角闪岩相变质作用,指示云开地体被卷入了加里东期的地壳增厚事件。&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>斑岩钼矿床中岩浆热液活动对铼富集的影响:以新疆苏云河Mo和白山Re-Mo矿床为例</title><link>https://doi.org/10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.11</link><guid>10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.11</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 02:39:25 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Tao HONG</dc:creator><dc:creator>PengLi JIAO</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chu WU</dc:creator><dc:creator>YueXin ZHANG</dc:creator><dc:creator>XingWang XU</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jun YOU</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiao ZHENG</dc:creator><dc:creator>Di LIU</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhang ZHANG</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Acta Petrologica Sinica</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.11</prism:doi><description>斑岩钼矿床是工业铼(Re)的主要来源,Re主要以类质同象形式进入辉钼矿晶格,对成矿流体物理化学条件极为敏感。本文以新疆西准噶尔苏云河Mo矿和东天山白山Re-Mo矿为研究对象,综合岩相学、矿相学和辉钼矿-石英LA-ICP-MS微量元素分析等手段,对比研究不同成矿阶段Re的含量变化及其控制因素。结果表明,两矿床辉钼矿均可分为片状或薄片状的Ⅰ型和细粒状集合体的Ⅱ型,Ⅱ型辉钼矿中Re含量系统性高于Ⅰ型,未见明显的"壳-核"式分带,辉钼矿普遍发育膝折构造,反映叠加成矿作用。苏云河矿床辉钼矿Re含量在各阶段变化幅度较大,岩浆-热液过渡阶段(T2)Re含量明显升高,局部样品表现出高S/Mo比值,指示Re在该阶段发生局部富集并出现过早结晶;白山矿床各阶段辉钼矿Re含量变化较小,成矿流体 f HCl/ f HF比值相对稳定,有利于Re在流体中的持续运移。综合石英Ti-温度计、流体包裹体及微量元素约束,认为成矿温度降低是控制Re进入辉钼矿晶格的首要因素,pH值和卤素组成则通过调节Re络合物形态控制其在成矿流体与辉钼矿之间的分配行为,二者共同决定了苏云河和白山矿床Re的差异性富集。

However, the factors controlling it remain unclear. We used a simplified, 3D conceptualization of an intraoceanic subduction zone and petrologic constraints on mantle melting to calculate mantle‐derived magma flux from the “bottom up”, and test the sensitivity of mantle‐derived magma flux to a variety of input variables. Estimates of mantle‐derived flux from our model can be compared to existing “top down” models based on erupted volumes and crustal growth models and is also a jumping‐off point from which more complex models of mantle‐derived magma flux at a variety of scales may be developed. We find that the total volume of mantle available to melt exerts the most significant control on mantle‐derived magma flux between different arcs. At a given arc, convergence rate and the extent of melting have the greatest impact on mantle‐derived magma flux. Variation in flux caused by variations in orthogonal convergence rates within the Aleutians may cause variability in mantle‐derived magma flux along‐arc.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Mantle‐derived magma flux has a first‐order control on long‐term volcanic productivity, volatile cycling, and crustal growth in convergent margins. However, the factors controlling it remain unclear. We used a simplified, 3D conceptualization of an intraoceanic subduction zone and petrologic constraints on mantle melting to calculate mantle‐derived magma flux from the “bottom up”, and test the sensitivity of mantle‐derived magma flux to a variety of input variables. Estimates of mantle‐derived flux from our model can be compared to existing “top down” models based on erupted volumes and crustal growth models and is also a jumping‐off point from which more complex models of mantle‐derived magma flux at a variety of scales may be developed. We find that the total volume of mantle available to melt exerts the most significant control on mantle‐derived magma flux between different arcs. At a given arc, convergence rate and the extent of melting have the greatest impact on mantle‐derived magma flux. Variation in flux caused by variations in orthogonal convergence rates within the Aleutians may cause variability in mantle‐derived magma flux along‐arc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>难熔元素同位素定年和示踪分析技术新进展</title><link>https://doi.org/10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.17</link><guid>10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.17</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 02:39:46 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>JiFeng XU</dc:creator><dc:creator>ZhuYin CHU</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jie LI</dc:creator><dc:creator>JinGao LIU</dc:creator><dc:creator>GuiQin WANG</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chao LI</dc:creator><dc:creator>BingYu Gao</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Acta Petrologica Sinica</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.17</prism:doi><description>Pt-Os、Hf-W和Re-Os同位素是难熔元素中三个重要放射性同位素体系,其在探究地球深部核幔物质循环、精确限定金属矿床成矿时代、揭示富有机质沉积岩(含油气藏样品)的年龄和物质来源等领域不可或缺。但现有同位素分析技术仍存在诸多不足,难以满足高精准分析的需求,迫切需要发展新技术提升测定精准度和分析效率。本文介绍了研究团队近年来在建立和革新难熔元素同位素体系分析技术方面的重要进展:(1)创建了不同于传统的多卡瑞斯管(Carius) Pt-Os同位素分析技术——锑试金Pt-Os同位素高精度分析新技术;(2)革新了两项W同位素高精度分析技术;(3)优化了金属矿床硫化物Re-Os同位素分析技术,提升了金属矿床年龄测定的定年精度;(4)完善了针对富有机质沉积岩(含油气藏样品)的准确定年和成因示踪技术,定年精度已达国际最佳水平。本文还对Pt-Os、Hf-W和Re-Os同位素体系分析技术未来研发方向提出了展望。

The contents of Mn, Fe, Cu, Ga, Ge, and In decrease with distance from the feeder fault, whereas the contents of Cd increase. Manganese, Fe, Ge, and Tl are also concentrated in early sphalerite, whereas Ga and Cd are more abundant in later sphalerite. Such variations appear to be predominantly governed by changes in physicochemical parameters, such as temperature, fS2, and fluid composition. Finally, multivariate regression analysis identified three footprint elements in sphalerite—Mn, Ga, and In—whose combined compositional variations are particularly informative concerning the relative distances of samples to the feeder fault. The application of the resultant sphalerite proximitor to another structurally controlled MVT deposit effectively traced fluid flow paths and identified the relative distances of samples to the fluid influx center.

Here, the authors report that co-doping LiCoO2 with nickel, iron, and palladium yields a durable electrode with stability of over 2,000 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>华北克拉通早前寒武纪稀有金属成矿作用</title><link>https://doi.org/10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.01</link><guid>10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.01</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 02:39:15 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>FuYuan WU</dc:creator><dc:creator>JiaHui XU</dc:creator><dc:creator>MenPin ZHANG</dc:creator><dc:creator>YueHeng YANG</dc:creator><dc:creator>FangYang HU</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hao YANG</dc:creator><dc:creator>Peng PENG</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Acta Petrologica Sinica</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.01</prism:doi><description>世界上主要克拉通大多都曾发育早前寒武纪伟晶岩型稀有金属成矿作用,但我国华北克拉通似乎是个例外。到目前为止,还没有在该区发现具有可观工业价值的早前寒武纪稀有金属伟晶岩。总结华北地区目前已有的研究线索发现,早前寒武纪稀有金属伟晶岩在华北克拉通普遍发育,并可划分为两个阶段。其一是太古宙晚期25亿年的伟晶岩,它主要分布在辽北-冀东-鲁西一带的太古宙地体上,与25亿年左右的早期克拉通化关系密切。此阶段伟晶岩赋存在太古宙绿岩地体的基性-超基性变火山岩中,其成矿类型以锂和钽为主,分别以山东新泰石棚锂辉石伟晶岩和辽宁新宾李家堡子铌钽矿伟晶岩为代表,代表了一种Li-Cs-Ta型伟晶岩的稀有金属成矿作用。其二是古元古代18亿年左右的伟晶岩,它遍布整个华北地区,但主要分布在古元古宙的辽吉活动带、内蒙古孔兹岩带和华北中部碰撞带等,与华北克拉通内部块体拼贴、碰撞及后期广泛的克拉通化有关。该期伟晶岩主要赋存在变质的表壳岩系之中,其成矿类型以铍、铌、钽、铀和稀土为主,以辽宁海城含铌铀伟晶岩和内蒙古乌拉山含铍伟晶岩为典型代表。目前在区内还没发现此期伟晶岩存在锂矿化的痕迹,反映了Nb-Y-F型为主的稀有金属成矿作用。通过与世界上典型克拉通(如澳大利亚、非洲、波罗的、北美等克拉通)稀有金属伟晶岩的对比发现,华北克拉通具有与它们基本一致的稀有金属成矿特征。华北克拉通早前寒武纪稀有金属伟晶岩型矿床稀少的原因,一方面与它较高的变质程度(或较强的剥蚀程度)有关,但研究和勘查程度不高可能也是不可忽视的重要因素。未来,在加强与世界典型克拉通对比研究的同时,应着重研究华北克拉通内部不同时代岩浆作用的背景、源区和演化特征,以期理解太古宙LCT型和古元古宙NYF型伟晶岩差异形成的原因,为华北早前寒武纪伟晶岩型稀有金属资源的突破提供理论依据。

&lt;p&gt;青藏高原的隆升过程一直是学术界长期关注的前沿科学问题,对理解大陆动力学演化与环境变化具有重要意义。位于拉萨地体南缘的冈底斯岩基是研究青藏高原构造隆升最为理想的区域。本文以冈底斯带曲水岩基及火山沉积地层为研究对象,系统采集了7个具有代表性的岩石样品,包括闪长岩、花岗岩、砂岩及安山岩等类型,通过结合磷灰石和锆石(U-Th)/He热年代学分析,对曲水岩基新生代的热演化历史进行了详细的约束。7个磷灰石样品的(U-Th)/He年龄加权平均值范围为6.9±1.6Ma~13.98±0.82Ma,其中邻近雅鲁藏布江的样品年龄明显年轻(6.9±1.6Ma),推测与河流侵蚀作用有关,其余样品年龄主要集中于中新世中期(~13Ma)。4个锆石样品的(U-Th)/He年龄加权平均值范围为17.0±1.6Ma~39.4±9.2Ma,仅最北部样品显示始新世年龄(39.4±9.2Ma),其余样品年龄均为中新世(~17Ma)。热历史模拟揭示冈底斯曲水岩基在新生代经历了两期显著的快速冷却过程:(1)始新世中期-渐新世早期(43~30Ma),可能与藏南拉萨的地壳增厚有关;(2)中新世早期-中期(21~10Ma),可能归因于拉萨岩石圈拆沉及软流圈上涌等深部动力学过程。此外,结合冈底斯岩基已有的低温热年代学数据,综合分析认为,冈底斯岩基新生代差异折返与区域构造活动、深部动力学过程和河流侵蚀等多重机制的协同作用密切相关。这些共同作用为理解青藏高原南缘的构造-地貌联系和隆升过程提供了新的制约和见解。&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>华北克拉通南缘少华山-崤山-熊耳山地区2.9~1.7Ga多期次花岗质岩浆作用成因与陆壳演化</title><link>https://doi.org/10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.02</link><guid>10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.02</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 02:39:17 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>YanYan ZHOU</dc:creator><dc:creator>YaLi ZHENG</dc:creator><dc:creator>YongFa DA</dc:creator><dc:creator>RuCheng ZHANG</dc:creator><dc:creator>XiYan ZHU</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lei ZHAO</dc:creator><dc:creator>TaiPing ZHAO</dc:creator><dc:creator>MingGuo ZHAI</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Acta Petrologica Sinica</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.18654/1000-0569/2026.01.02</prism:doi><description>华北克拉通太古宙-古元古代的构造-岩浆-沉积记录丰富、完整,是研究早期陆壳多阶段增生和演化规律的天然实验室。然而,目前关于其早期陆壳增生机制和构造演变过程仍存有争议。华北克拉通南缘太华杂岩发育完整的太古宙-古元古代结晶基底,出露丰富的TTG及基性-花岗质岩石组合,是研究早期陆壳生长和演化的理想区域。本文聚焦华北克拉通南缘少华山-崤山-熊耳山地区2.9~1.7Ga的TTG及花岗质岩石,开展系统的岩石学、年代学和地球化学的研究。结果显示,研究区至少发育七期TTG及花岗质岩浆作用,包括~2.9Ga英云闪长岩(TTG)、~2.7Ga花岗闪长岩(TTG)、2.53~2.42Ga英云闪长岩(TTG)和钾长-二长花岗岩、2.33~2.27Ga奥长花岗岩(TTG)、闪长岩和钾长-二长花岗岩、2.22~2.19Ga二长花岗岩及侵入TTG片麻岩中的浅色脉体、1.94~1.81Ga钾长-二长花岗岩-花岗闪长岩,以及1.78~1.76Ga的钾长-二长花岗岩。其中,2.9~2.3Ga TTG以中-低压型为主;~2.5Ga的花岗质岩石显示I-S型花岗岩特征;~2.3Ga、~2.2Ga及~1.7Ga的花岗质岩石类似于A型花岗岩;1.94~1.81Ga同时发育A型花岗岩和I-S型花岗岩。~2.9Ga、~2.7Ga和~2.5Ga的三期TTG和~2.5Ga花岗质岩石记录了早期陆壳多阶段的生长和演化,可能形成于俯冲-碰撞的构造环境。~2.3Ga TTG总体具有低压特征,来自基性下地壳在高地温梯度下的部分熔融,与同期古老富集地幔来源的闪长岩和板内A型花岗岩一起指示板内伸展环境。2.2~2.1Ga A型花岗岩来自古老陆壳物质的重熔,结合已有2.3~2.1Ga双峰式火山岩、A型花岗岩、低 δ 18 O花岗岩-辉长闪长岩等,指示了伸展-裂解背景下不同深度地壳和地幔的再循环。1.94~1.81Ga I-S型花岗岩和A型花岗岩可能记录了古元古代俯冲-碰撞拼合的历史。1.78~1.76Ga A型花岗岩可能是板内伸展-裂解作用下的陆壳减薄诱发地壳部分熔融的产物。华北克拉通南缘太古宙-古元古代广泛发育的花岗质岩浆作用记录了多阶段的陆壳生长、演化和构造体制转型,为揭示不同阶段地球圈层物质循环规律和动力学过程提供了关键约束。

We suggest crustal growth and mineral endowment in some greenstone belts were similarly regulated by microplate formation. Because the microplates behave independently, often at great distances from the nearest subduction zone, their formation is akin to autochthonous growth in the Archean when subduction-zone processes were either absent or in their infancy.

&lt;p&gt;镁铁质-超镁铁质晶粥由于镁铁质矿物晶体比例较大,晶间熔体比例较小,故镁铁-超镁铁质晶粥之间的混合并不会发生大范围混合。目前,关于其混合机制的研究工作还较为薄弱。本次工作以黄山东岩浆铜镍矿床中的镁铁质岩与超镁铁质岩之间的岩相过渡段作为研究对象,进行全岩地球化学、矿物地球化学分析,并进行数值模拟计算,借此来探讨镁铁质-超镁铁质晶粥间的混合过程。黄山东矿床ZK+10-1钻孔中发现辉石岩下部与角闪辉长岩上部以及角闪辉长岩下部与二辉橄榄岩之间存在两个长度不一的岩相过渡段。上部过渡段长度较长,其中出现斜长石捕掳晶,且捕掳晶与硫化物的含量均随深度增加而增多;下部岩性过渡段长度较短,并没有出现斜长石与硫化物的含量变化。岩石及矿物地球化学特征显示,超镁铁质岩浆的注入会导致岩相过渡段的Cr 2 O 3 含量上升,并使其中的斜长石产生反环带结构,但是不同的SiO 2 、CaO、Al 2 O 3 的变化趋势代表了不同的混合方式。当辉石岩晶粥从上方侵入角闪辉长岩晶粥时,由于受到重力的作用,辉石岩晶粥中较大密度的硫化物发生沉降,但不能大量渗滤进入下方粘度较大的角闪辉长岩晶粥中,这与数值模拟计算的结果相吻合;角闪辉长岩晶粥的顶部在被上方辉石岩晶粥加热后,自身的粘度减小,密度较低的斜长石会获得更大的浮力导致向上运移形成捕掳晶。在当密度大的超镁铁质晶粥从下方侵入镁铁质晶粥时,只能发生简单机械的混合。所以在镁铁-超镁铁质晶粥间的混合主要由于密度差,导致两种晶粥间的矿物之间发生交换,同时粘度、孔隙度等因素均对混合过程有着一定程度的影响。&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Structured liquid-based reconfigurable all-liquid optical fibers</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67954-4</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-67954-4</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:34:06 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sai Zhao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yufeng Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xinke Tang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jiangang Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Weixi Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yuchen Fu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sai Tak Chu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yang Ren</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xubo Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xun Guan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Thomas P.

A commonly proposed origin of this discontinuity is the transformation of bridgmanite (Bdm) to a post‐perovskite structure (Bdm‐ppv) but this generally produces results that do not match all the seismic observations. In this work we build a thermodynamic model of this transition using ab initio calculations incorporating the effects of Fe, Al, and Ca and predict that it is not one but two overlapping transitions. The second transition is the high temperature (&gt;∼2,700 K) dissolution of Davemaoite (Dvm) phases into the Bdm phase to make a chemically mixed Bdm‐Dvm phase. This reaction is controlled by Dvm and ferropericlase (fp) phases which means different mineralogical compositions will exhibit different phase behaviors and thus different seismic and dynamical behaviors near the CMB. We predict that assemblages with pyrolitic compositions match closest to the seismic observations of the D″ and that the presence of velocity increases near the top of the D″ followed by linked velocity increases near the CMB are both indicators of pyrolitic assemblages. Harzburgitic and basaltic mixtures are predicted to lack some of these features. In a pyrolitic mantle we then predict the existence of Bdm‐Dvm at the CMB which will have different chemical, thermal and dynamical properties to Bdm + Dvm and could alter interactions between the mantle and the core.
