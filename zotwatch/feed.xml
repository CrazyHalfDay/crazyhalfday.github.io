In this study, we thoroughly conducted Hg isotopic analyses of minerals (pyrite and chalcopyrite) and host rocks, combined to in-situ trace element and Fe redox states of chlorite (i.e. Fe 3+ /∑Fe determined by synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structure) from the Early to Middle Devonian, large-tonnage Ashele VMS deposit in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, in order to understand the sources of ore-forming metals and metallogenic processes. Our results show that ore-associated sulfides and igneous rocks display a wide variation of 0.35‰ in Δ 199 Hg (−0.17‰ to 0.18‰), which overlaps with those of seawater (∼0.2‰), primitive mantle (∼0‰) and continental sediments (∼-0.25‰), supporting a ternary mixing of Hg from three distinct sources. Most of the ore-associated sulfides show near-zero Δ 199 Hg values of −0.1 to 0.1‰, suggesting that ore metals were primarily derived from magmatic fluids, rather than from leaching of underlying volcanic host rocks by heated seawater. The THg (total Hg) content in sulfides and chlorite decreases with increasing distance from the mineralization center, reflecting the variable influence of magmatic volatiles released from the underlying magmatic system, while fluid boiling likely leads to significant variations in δ 202 Hg (exceeding 2‰). The elevated Fe 3+ /∑Fe values, distinct Hg and Sn enrichments, and high formation temperatures (above 400 °C) recorded by Hg-rich chlorite suggest that acidic, hot, oxidized, metal-rich volatiles facilitate the transport of Cu and S from the magmatic to the hydrothermal environment, promoting the formation of large VMS deposits. We propose that the Early Devonian extensional setting enabled oxidized magmatism and volatiles, facilitating efficient Cu and S transport, during which the metal-rich magmatic-hydrothermal fluids (Δ 199 Hg ≈ 0) mixed with seawater (Δ 199 Hg &gt; 0) and continental sediments (Δ 199 Hg 199 Hg range. Consequently, our results indicate Hg isotopes and the chemical composition and Fe redox states of chlorite can be applied to reveal metal source and mineralization processes in ancient VMS deposits and may also serve as a valuable exploration guide for VMS systems.

Two main processes have been invoked, namely extreme differentiation of a peraluminous granitic magma and direct anatexis of a sedimentary protolith. We use geochemical modeling to quantify lithium enrichment via these two processes from a study of the Jiajika lithium pegmatite field, one of the largest of its type in the world. Based on a lithium–silicon–boron–barium (Li-Si-B-Ba) isotope study involving systematic sampling along 4,211-m of core from two deep boreholes and from the regional zonation of pegmatites at outcrops, we propose a three-stage model for the formation of the pegmatite field: i) generation of a rare metal-rich melt by deep anatexis, involving ~5% partial melting of metapelitic rocks in the presence of 10 to 30% metamorphic fluid; ii) gradual enrichment of rare metals along a path of continuous magma differentiation until 75% of the initial melt had crystallized; and iii) a final stage of lithium mineralization during the escape of the water-rich magma due to the overpressures created in response to massive fluid exsolution and the extensional stress in the granite dome structure. The study provides important insights into how lithium-rich pegmatites can be targeted during exploration for pegmatite-hosted resources of lithium.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the economic importance of lithium, there is considerable disagreement over the processes that concentrate it and other rare metals in pegmatite-type lithium deposits. Two main processes have been invoked, namely extreme differentiation of a peraluminous granitic magma and direct anatexis of a sedimentary protolith. We use geochemical modeling to quantify lithium enrichment via these two processes from a study of the Jiajika lithium pegmatite field, one of the largest of its type in the world. Based on a lithium–silicon–boron–barium (Li-Si-B-Ba) isotope study involving systematic sampling along 4,211-m of core from two deep boreholes and from the regional zonation of pegmatites at outcrops, we propose a three-stage model for the formation of the pegmatite field: i) generation of a rare metal-rich melt by deep anatexis, involving ~5% partial melting of metapelitic rocks in the presence of 10 to 30% metamorphic fluid; ii) gradual enrichment of rare metals along a path of continuous magma differentiation until 75% of the initial melt had crystallized; and iii) a final stage of lithium mineralization during the escape of the water-rich magma due to the overpressures created in response to massive fluid exsolution and the extensional stress in the granite dome structure. The study provides important insights into how lithium-rich pegmatites can be targeted during exploration for pegmatite-hosted resources of lithium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The high oxygen fugacity of the chang’e-5 lunar basalt: Implications for redox stratification of the lunar mantle</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2026.01.046</link><guid>10.1016/j.gca.2026.01.046</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:19:07 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jintuan Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hongluo L.

PGE systematics (ΣPGE ≈ 8–26 ppb; modest Pt–Pd enrichment over Os–Ir–Ru; low Pd/Ir=1.18-1.61) record moderate partial melting followed by selective mobilization of PPGEs during serpentinization, preserving a dominantly magmatic signature with a limited metasomatic overprint. We propose the JMM serpentinites originated as a highly depleted mantle residue during intra-oceanic subduction initiation. It was subsequently serpentinized by slab-derived fluids under fore-arc conditions before being tectonically emplaced onto the Arabian margin during Late Cretaceous ophiolite obduction. Relative to the main Semail mantle section, the JMM captures an earlier, less-evolved snapshot of fore-arc development during Late Cretaceous obduction, refining models for Neo-Tethyan subduction initiation and ophiolite assembly.

However, the processes occurring from melt formation to evolution following crustal anatexis, as well as their contributions to magma compositions, remain unclear. This study characterizes the chemical composition and B isotope systematics of tourmaline and muscovite, along with whole-rock geochemistry in high-silica granitic rocks from the central Himalaya. We use these data to constrain the melt formation and subsequent fluid-magma interactions in high-silica granites. The leucosomes exhibit high CaO, Sr, Sr/Y, and Eu/Eu* values but low Rb and Rb/Sr contents, characteristic of hydration melting. Muscovite in the leucosomes shows a significant B isotope range (δ 11 B = −20.6‰ to −5.8‰), with δ 11 B values displaying negative correlations with B, Rb, and Cs contents, and positive correlations with Rb/Cs ratios. These patterns reflect increasing muscovite breakdown during prograde hydration melting. The leucogranites were classified into two groups, including tourmaline and two-mica leucogranites. Compared to the two-mica leucogranites, the tourmaline leucogranites are characterized by higher Rb, Rb/Sr, but lower CaO, Sr/Y, Eu/Eu*, and muscovite δ 11 B values. These geochemical differences primarily reflect distinct melting reactions: tourmaline leucogranites result from muscovite dehydration melting, whereas two-mica leucogranites form through hydration melting. In tourmaline leucogranites, tourmaline exhibits δ 11 B ranging from −18.2‰ to −13.5‰, with increasing δ 11 B values and Nb, Ta, and rare earth element (REE) contents from core to rim, indicative of fluid-magma interactions. Magmatic fluid metasomatism also explains the muscovite B isotopic zoning from both leucogranite types, with rims showing elevated δ 11 B, Rb, Cs, and B values alongside notably decreased Nb/Ta ratios. Geochemical modeling suggests that fluid–magma interaction with fluid/magma ratios of 0.2–0.6 could produce the observed B isotopic zoning. Therefore, in-situ tourmaline and muscovite B systematic studies reveal the role of magmatic fluids in the generation of the Himalayan leucogranites. Furthermore, the leucogranites exhibit higher whole-rock and muscovite rare-metal (Li, Nb, Ta, Rb, and Cs) contents than the leucosomes. The rare metals increased, accompanied by the sharply decreased Nb/Ta ratios in the muscovite rims. This evidence supports that the magmatic fluid metasomatism represents a key mechanism for elevating rare metal contents in high-silica granites.

We report the first measurements of δ 7 Li for eleven of the main rivers in Guadeloupe and four thermal springs on the slopes of La Soufrière volcano. We have measured a large range of δ 7 Li values (3.0–31.6‰) that we explained by different water–rock interaction processes at the scale of this small island. First, the rivers affected by hydrothermal inputs are the most concentrated and isotopically lighter (δ 7 Li from 3.0–12.3‰). This is partly attributed to the leaching and dissolution of clay-rich, hydrothermally-altered rocks which are presumed to have low δ 7 Li value and to the discharge from the hot-springs on La Soufrière volcano. The rivers not impacted by hydrothermal inputs are more diluted and isotopically heavier (δ 7 Li from 16.0–31.6‰), highlighting two distinct weathering processes in the regolith: the precipitation and dissolution of secondary minerals. In the youngest part of the island, the rivers are characterized by high δ 7 Li values, emphasizing that dissolved lithium is mainly controlled by the dissolution of primary andesitic minerals and the incorporation of 6 Li into secondary minerals. While in the oldest part of the island, the rivers are characterized by lower δ 7 Li values, which are partly attributed to a low δ 7 Li source from the dissolution of secondary minerals in the regolith. We also show a positive correlation between δ 7 Li in river waters and the chemical weathering rates (CWR), related to the weatherable primary minerals content in watersheds. We note that this content is linked to rock age, precipitation, regolith type/thickness and geomorphologic parameters such as elevation and slope.

&lt;p&gt;This study examines the lithium isotope (δ 7 Li) geochemistry of waters flowing through andesitic rocks in order to better constrain the dissolved lithium dynamic in a tropical volcanic island context. We report the first measurements of δ 7 Li for eleven of the main rivers in Guadeloupe and four thermal springs on the slopes of La Soufrière volcano. We have measured a large range of δ 7 Li values (3.0–31.6‰) that we explained by different water–rock interaction processes at the scale of this small island. First, the rivers affected by hydrothermal inputs are the most concentrated and isotopically lighter (δ 7 Li from 3.0–12.3‰). This is partly attributed to the leaching and dissolution of clay-rich, hydrothermally-altered rocks which are presumed to have low δ 7 Li value and to the discharge from the hot-springs on La Soufrière volcano. The rivers not impacted by hydrothermal inputs are more diluted and isotopically heavier (δ 7 Li from 16.0–31.6‰), highlighting two distinct weathering processes in the regolith: the precipitation and dissolution of secondary minerals. In the youngest part of the island, the rivers are characterized by high δ 7 Li values, emphasizing that dissolved lithium is mainly controlled by the dissolution of primary andesitic minerals and the incorporation of 6 Li into secondary minerals. While in the oldest part of the island, the rivers are characterized by lower δ 7 Li values, which are partly attributed to a low δ 7 Li source from the dissolution of secondary minerals in the regolith. We also show a positive correlation between δ 7 Li in river waters and the chemical weathering rates (CWR), related to the weatherable primary minerals content in watersheds. We note that this content is linked to rock age, precipitation, regolith type/thickness and geomorphologic parameters such as elevation and slope.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Author Correction: Bridging the gap between subduction dynamics and the long-term strength of the Sunda megathrust</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69141-5</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-026-69141-5</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:27:22 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Fabio A.

The Awati-Manjar transition zone in the northern Tarim Basin contains extensive mafic intrusions, predominantly composed of diabases, making it a critical region for strengthening our understanding of the evolution and dynamics of the Tarim LIP. In this paper, we conducted an integrated analysis of the newly identified diabase intrusions in the Awati-Manjar transition zone of the northern Tarim Basin, including seismic and drilling data interpretation, petrographic observations, U-Pb isotopic dating, and whole-rock elemental and Sr-Nd isotopic analyses. Seismic and drilling data reveal two distinct occurrence models for the diabase intrusions: sill-shaped and saucer-shaped. Apatite U-Pb dating indicates that the diabases range in age from ca. 308 Ma to 266 Ma, with two distinguishable emplacement episodes identified within analytical uncertainty of 308−299 Ma and 286−266 Ma. The diabases from the earlier episode are sparsely distributed across the study area, whereas those from the later episode are widespread and constitute the majority of the diabase intrusions in the region. Geochemically, the diabases belong to an alkaline, sodium-rich, and high-Ti series. They exhibit consistent chondrite-normalized rare earth element and primitive mantle−normalized trace element patterns, marked by pronounced enrichment in light rare earth elements and highly incompatible elements, respectively. Notably, no Eu anomaly is observed, while distinct positive anomalies are present at Ba and Pb. Whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic analyses reveal relatively depleted signatures, with (87Sr/86Sr)i ratios ranging from 0.7049 to 0.7074 and εNd(t) values from +0.60 to +2.75. Both elemental and isotopic data indicate that the diabases are compositionally analogous to oceanic-island basalt, implying a genetic link to a mantle plume. That is, they were likely formed through partial melting of a mantle plume source, followed by variable degrees of crustal assimilation and fractional crystallization. More significantly, our newly acquired geological data reveal that the mafic intrusions within the Tarim LIP actually exhibit a longer emplacement duration (spanning the entire lifespan of the Tarim LIP) and a broader spatial distribution (extending beyond the craton margins into its interior) than previously considered. To account for these observed characteristics, a new integrated crust-mantle interaction model has been developed.

By incorporating experimental constrained eclogitization and melting conditions at high temperature and pressure conditions into 2‐D petrological‐thermomechanical numerical models, we systematically model an intracontinental delamination process. The numerical experiments show that delaminated segments force hot asthenospheric mantle upwards, causing characteristic magmatic expression in the overriding continental lithosphere.

The material produced by the interaction between the partial melting of the delaminated segments and deep mantle peridotite would be brought up with the hot mantle upwelling, generating igneous rocks in the intracontinental crust. The crustal magmatism from delamination is expressed in two stages: (a) a rapid phase of high‐volume magmatism related to the detachment of lower lithosphere and replacement with asthenosphere; and (b) a slower and extended phase of magmatism associated with partial melting of the foundered lithosphere in the MTZ. The model provides a novel explanation for the regional intracontinental magmatism that is characterized by a short‐term volcanic climax and a subsequent longer‐term weakened magmatism in the Songliao Basin since the late Mesozoic.
