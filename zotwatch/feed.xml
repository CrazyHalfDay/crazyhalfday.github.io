However, quantitative constraints on permeability in deep fault rocks remain limited. We present new laboratory measurements of permeability, porosity, and specific storage on cataclasite‐ and pseudotachylyte‐bearing mylonitic rocks along the Red River Fault (RRF), China. Experiments conducted at effective pressures up to 165 MPa reveal systematically low permeabilities, with mylonitized cataclasites and pseudotachylyte‐bearing rocks exhibiting the lowest values (10 −22 –10 −21 m 2 ), while mylonites display relatively higher permeabilities, up to 10 −19 m 2 . A key finding is the pronounced permeability anisotropy, where permeability parallel to foliation is up to two orders of magnitude greater than perpendicular values. This anisotropy reflects the microstructural alignment of phyllosilicate minerals and cavitation bands, which provides interconnected flow pathways along foliation while impeding cross‐foliation transport. The hydraulic architecture of the RRF at the base of the seismogenic zone is thus characterized by overall low permeabilities with fluid flow facilitated along mylonitic foliation. Such fabric‐controlled anisotropy persists even under mid‐crustal pressure conditions, indicating that fault zones at the base of seismogenic depths can retain directional fluid pathways despite overall low permeabilities. Our results provide critical constraints on the hydraulic architecture of the RRF and offer broader insights into the role of anisotropy in controlling fluid flow and deformation at the base of the seismogenic zone.

While silicon and other inorganic semiconductor-based photodiodes have been widely integrated into commercial technologies, photodiodes from excitonic semiconductors continue to maintain high interest in research. Excitonic semiconductors are superior in terms of absorption as compared to silicon and III-V semiconductors, but have always suffered from poor charge transport and narrow band absorption due to the short diffusion lengths and resonant nature of the excitons, respectively. Here, we attempt to solve both these central issues in excitonic photodiode devices via use of polariton physics and demonstrating photodiodes in the strong light-matter coupling regime. By using a conductive tin-doped indium oxide transparent top electrode that also serves as an anti-reflective coating combined with self-trapping and hybridization of light in inorganic excitonic semiconductor WS2, we demonstrate photodiodes with broadband absorption and internal quantum efficiency values approaching unity near the zero-detuning condition. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the response speed of photodiodes is enhanced under strong coupling. Our work presents a promising approach to explore the physics and applications of photodiodes based on excitonic semiconductors. While excitonic semiconductors offer appealing optical properties, their application for competitive optoelectronic devices has remained limited. Here, the authors report the realization of broadband exciton-polariton photodiodes based on a layered excitonic semiconductor, WS2, contacted by tin-doped indium oxide in an open optical cavity design, showing ~MHz bandwidth at room temperature.

This study develops a bioengineered nanolamellar system to sequentially restore neuronal cell mitochondrial function and modulate microglial polarization to mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Glacial Expansion of Deoxygenation in the Arabian Sea</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025gl118449</link><guid>10.1029/2025gl118449</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 11:24:46 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Deepak Kumar Rai</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jitender Kumar</dc:creator><dc:creator>Abul Qasim</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sanjeev Kumar</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ravi Bhushan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kaustubh Thirumalai</dc:creator><dc:creator>Arvind Singh</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Geophysical Research Letters</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1029/2025gl118449</prism:doi><description>Abstract The mechanisms by which ongoing climate change influences ocean Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) are insufficiently understood, making it essential to examine their long‐term variations under substantial climatic forcing.

In an Alzheimer’s disease model, GARDEN localizes C1qa/C1qb-marked microglia in amyloid-β regions and reveals key immune pathways. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma it identifies tiny tertiary lymphoid structures, and in breast cancer it uncovers inflammatory M1-like macrophages near ductal carcinoma in situ and links them to pro-metastatic signaling. An interpretation module pinpoints key immune signatures, and GARDEN extends to spatial chromatin accessibility, providing insight into epigenetic regulation and informing diagnostics and therapeutic targeting. Spatial omics maps molecular features to tissue architecture, but it often misses rare cell populations. Here, the authors present GARDEN, a graph-based framework that detects pathogenic cells and regions across spatial omics, enables 3D tissue reconstruction, and reveals immune and regulatory mechanisms in several diseases.

This work highlights the potential of macrocycle-assembled membranes for high-salinity organic wastewater treatment. Macrocyclic polymer membranes are well suited for wastewater treatment, though it is challenging to fabricate porous networks using macrocycles.
