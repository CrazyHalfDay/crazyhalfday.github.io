This buffer layer facilitates a physisorption interface between Co and graphene with a well-defined vdW gap, which functions as an effective spin tunnel barrier. Through buffer layer thickness optimization, we achieved a room-temperature spin injection efficiency of approximately 25% in graphene, comparable to the best single-crystalline oxide-tunnel-barrier-based devices, alongside explicit nonlocal spin valve signals and Hanle spin precession. We further demonstrate the scalability of our approach through uniform performance across multi-channel graphene spin valves and its versatility by achieving efficient spin injection in semiconducting MoS2 with an average efficiency of about 19.7%. Our strategy offers a simple, cost-efficient, and industry-compatible method for future large-scale and efficient spintronic applications. Researchers developed a simple, industry-compatible method using an indium buffer layer between cobalt and 2D materials to form vdWs tunnel contacts.

We further demonstrate the scalability of our approach through uniform performance across multi-channel graphene spin valves and its versatility by achieving efficient spin injection in semiconducting MoS2 with an average efficiency of about 19.7%. Our strategy offers a simple, cost-efficient, and industry-compatible method for future large-scale and efficient spintronic applications. Researchers developed a simple, industry-compatible method using an indium buffer layer between cobalt and 2D materials to form vdWs tunnel contacts. This achieved high spin injection efficiency in both graphene and MoS2, enabling future large-scale spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Minimal impact of recent decline in C4 vegetation abundance on atmospheric carbon isotopic composition</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-025-03102-6</link><guid>10.1038/s43247-025-03102-6</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 13:54:39 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Aliénor Lavergne</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sandy P.

Here, we use a parsimonious model of C 3 and C 4 plant distribution, based on optimality principles, combined with a simplified representation of the global carbon cycle, to assess how shifts in plant abundances driven by carbon dioxide and climate affect global gross primary production, land carbon isotope discrimination, and the isotopic composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide. We estimate that the proportion of C 4 plants in total biomass declined from about 16% to 12% between 1982 and 2016, despite an increase in the abundance of C 4 crops. This decline reflects the reduced competitive advantage of C 4 photosynthesis in a carbon dioxide-enriched atmosphere. As a result, global gross primary production rose by approximately 16.5 ± 1.8 petagrams of carbon, and land carbon isotope discrimination increased by 0.017 ± 0.001‰ per year. Accounting for changes in C 3 and C 4 abundances reduces the difference between observed and modeled trends in atmospheric carbon isotope composition, but does not fully explain the observed decrease, pointing to additional, unaccounted drivers.

This study analyzes hyperspectral data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , focusing on regions along the Martian crustal dichotomy—where clay deposits occur at the boundary between the ancient southern highlands and the younger northern lowlands. We systematically surveyed ∼1500 CRISM targeted observations (1–2.6 μm) to identify ferromagnesian clays, distinguish them from other hydrated minerals, and characterize compositional differences between Fe‐ and Mg‐rich species using diagnostic absorptions around 1.4, 2.3, and 2.4 μm.

Oxia Planum—the Rosalind Franklin rover landing site—exhibits more compositionally intermediate clays such as vermiculites and ferrosaponites. These differences may reflect variations in the iron and magnesium abundance or in the iron oxidation state. Moreover, a recurring absorption near 2.5 μm suggests co‐occurring carbonates like magnesite and siderite, increasing the potential for biosignature preservation.

Within the imaged region, only one hot spot was previously known (Pfd454). This feature was earlier estimated to cover an area of 300 km 2 with a total power output of 34 GW.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract On 27 December 2024, Juno&amp;#x27;s JIRAM (Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper) instrument observed an unprecedented volcanic event in Io&amp;#x27;s southern hemisphere, covering a vast region of ∼65,000 km 2 , near 73°S, 140°E. Within the imaged region, only one hot spot was previously known (Pfd454). This feature was earlier estimated to cover an area of 300 km 2 with a total power output of 34 GW. JIRAM results show that the region produces a power output of 140–260 TW, over 1,000 times higher than earlier estimates and likely exceeding the brightest eruption ever recorded on Io, that of Surt in 2001 (∼80 TW). Three adjacent hot spots also exhibited dramatic power increases: P139, PV18, and an unnamed feature south of the main one that surged to ∼1 TW, placing all of them among the top 10 most powerful hot spots observed on Io. A temperature analysis of the features supports the simultaneous onset of these brightenings and suggests a single eruptive event propagating beneath the surface across hundreds of kilometers; this is the first time this has been observed on Io. This in turn would imply a connection among the hotspots&amp;#x27; magma reservoirs, while other nearby hotspots that have been known to be active in the recent past, such as Kurdalagon Patera, appear unaffected. The simultaneity supports models of massive, interconnected magma reservoirs. The topology of these regional magma systems may resemble that of a large‐scale sponge, in which the massive reservoirs are the pores, interconnected through a largely solid outer shell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Dual-action bisphosphonate hydrogel preserves cortical bone integrity and restores healing cascade in osteoporotic fracture-related infection</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-68036-1</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-68036-1</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 08:54:17 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jie Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yang Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yi Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yanjie Xu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hui Xu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Qiangjun Ling</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhen Tian</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chen Ling</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ziyang Tang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kiram Abdukahar</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yang Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zongshan Hu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yong Qiu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Liming Bian</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zezhang Zhu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kunyu Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhen Liu</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-68036-1</prism:doi><description>In osteoporotic fracture-related infection (FRI), the coordinated bone healing is compromised by cortical bone lysis and persistent bacterial colonization.

The medium silt size fraction is a strong source discriminator, dictates bulk sediment magnetic property variations, and helps characterize a new magnetic source fingerprint for Laurentia. In contrast, bulk sediment magnetic properties are an average of the properties of the individual fractions weighted by the magnetic concentration of those fractions and their abundance. Bulk sample averaging is observed across magnetic methods, which mutes individual grain‐size property variations that convolve source signatures and transport driven texture variations. Grain‐size‐specific approaches can help to restrict textural variance to isolate source signatures, track sediment texture changes independently of magnetic variation and provenance changes, facilitate process‐based interpretations, and provide sedimentology‐based insights into these important paleo‐archives and their recorded paleo‐environmental changes.
