Textural, chemical, and isotopic characteristics of hydrothermal pyrite and apatite from gold veins provide crucial constraints on fluid compositions, which can potentially reflect episodic variations in source reservoirs and/or changes in fluid physicochemical conditions. This study presents detailed textural observations, in-situ trace element analyses, and S-Pb isotopic data for multiple texturally distinct pyrite generations from the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou structurally controlled gold deposit in the Tongbai Orogen. Integrated with hydrothermal apatite U-Pb ages and Sr isotopic compositions, these results offer new constraints on the deposit’s fluid source, evolutionary history, and genetic mechanism. Two primary types of gold mineralization are identified: (1) altered rock-type ores (predominantly disseminated and veinlet-style) dominated by invisible gold-bearing arsenian pyrite (particularly Py2c and Py3) and minor base metal sulfides, accompanied by intense wall-rock alteration (muscovitization, sulfidation, carbonatization, silicification); and (2) vein-type ores (quartz veins), characterized by visible gold, As- and Au-poor pyrite (Py4 and Py5), and abundant base metal sulfides, with limited alteration halos dominated by muscovite and quartz. Five mineralization stages (I–V) are distinguished, corresponding to seven texturally and temporally distinct pyrite generations: Py1 (Stage I), Py2a–Py2c (Stage II), Py3 (Stage III), Py4 (Stage IV), and Py5 (Stage V). LA-ICP-MS trace element analyses reveal systematic compositional differences between pyrites from the two ore types: altered rock-type pyrites (Py1–Py3) are enriched in Au (median 15 ppm in Py1, 195 ppm in Py3), As (median 2872 ppm in Py1, 26868 ppm in Py2b), Co (median 90 ppm in Py1, 177 ppm in Py3), and Ni (median 80 ppm in Py1, 75 ppm in Py3). Stage II Py2 exhibits a core-mantle-rim zoning, with an Au- and As-poor Py2a core, a porous and inclusion-rich Au-As-enriched Py2b mantle, and an oscillatory-zoned Au-As-rich Py2c rim). In contrast, vein-type pyrites (Py4–Py5) are severely depleted in Au (median 0.01 ppm in Py4, 0.03 ppm in Py5) and As (median 3.1 ppm in Py4, 1.1 ppm in Py5), with significantly lower concentrations of other trace metals (e.g., Co ≤ 32 ppm, Ni ≤ 95 ppm). Oscillatory zoning of lattice-bound As and Au in altered rock-type pyrites (Py2b and Py3) is attributed to cyclic fluid immiscibility and vapor condensation driven by pressure fluctuations. Subsequent fluid immiscibility and cooling promoted the co-precipitation of visible gold and base metal sulfides in vein-type ores. Sulfur isotope compositions (δ3⁴S) of sulfides from Stages I–III altered rock-type ores range from −1.7‰ to 9.5‰, indicating a mixed sulfur source involving magmatic and host-rock components. In Stages IV–V vein-type ores, sulfides and baryte display δ3⁴S values of −3.9‰ to 5.6‰ and 8.2‰ to 14.5‰, respectively; texturally equilibrated pyrite and baryte yield a calculated total sulfur δ3⁴S value of 4.9‰, consistent with a predominantly magmatic sulfur source. Pyrite and galena exhibit consistent in-situ Pb isotope compositions across all mineralization stages, pointing to a common lead source. Vein-hosted calcite (Stages IV–V) and scheelite (Stage V) display ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios of 0.7089–0.7102, indicative of magmatic Sr. In contrast, altered rock-type ankerite (Stages II–III) and apatite (Stage II) show more radiogenic Sr isotopic compositions (0.7115–0.7142), suggesting intense fluid-rock interaction. Hydrothermal apatite intergrown with Stage II pyrite yields a U-Pb age of 133.2 ± 5.0 Ma, consistent with the previously reported Rb-Sr isochron age (132.6 ± 2.7 Ma) for vein-type ores and the emplacement age of adjacent Qijianfeng granite (140–130 Ma). Collectively, field observations, textural analyses, geochronological data, compositional studies, and S-Pb-Sr isotopic results demonstrate that the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou gold mineralization was derived from a single Early Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal fluid system. Spatial and temporal variations in fluid physicochemical parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity) and fluid-rock interactions account for the observed mineralogical diversity within this structurally controlled gold system.

Hydrothermal apatite intergrown with Stage II pyrite yields a U-Pb age of 133.2 ± 5.0 Ma, consistent with the previously reported Rb-Sr isochron age (132.6 ± 2.7 Ma) for vein-type ores and the emplacement age of adjacent Qijianfeng granite (140–130 Ma). Collectively, field observations, textural analyses, geochronological data, compositional studies, and S-Pb-Sr isotopic results demonstrate that the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou gold mineralization was derived from a single Early Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal fluid system. Spatial and temporal variations in fluid physicochemical parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity) and fluid-rock interactions account for the observed mineralogical diversity within this structurally controlled gold system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Diamond evidence for limited subduction of phosphorus into the lower mantle</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1130/g54011.1</link><guid>10.1130/g54011.1</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 20:45:25 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Qiwei Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Frank E.

Applying this calibration to magmatic olivine from 22 kimberlites yields reconstructed Na2Omelt of 1.9−8.6 wt% (typically ±0.25 wt%) at 1 GPa, showing that magmatic Na contents are much higher than indicated by bulk rock measurements. The lower range of these reconstructed Na2O values aligns with the predicted 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% of asthenospheric carbonated silicate melts generated from typical lherzolitic mantle at 7 GPa. The higher values correspond to the same 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% if recalculated for olivine crystallization at 2−4 GPa. Because Na2O loss through fluid exsolution during kimberlite ascent cannot exceed 0.5 wt%, the extreme Na loss leading to the observed low bulk-kimberlite values must occur upon solidification when copious amounts of Na-rich fluids are expelled. These findings suggest that kimberlitic melts do not require a peculiar mantle source, but rather carbon-bearing fertile lherzolites that melt at adiabatic conditions, placing kimberlites into a broad continuum with primitive alkaline ocean island melts.

This study further highlights the striking parallels between the CAOB and the present-day Southwest Pacific as archipelagic accretionary orogenic systems, offering valuable insights for comparative tectonic studies and advancing our understanding of orogenic belt evolution.

This study further highlights the striking parallels between the CAOB and the present-day Southwest Pacific as archipelagic accretionary orogenic systems, offering valuable insights for comparative tectonic studies and advancing our understanding of orogenic belt evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Temperature Controls on Carbon‐Sulfur Diagenesis in Deep Hydrothermal Subseafloor Sediments</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025gl119353</link><guid>10.1029/2025gl119353</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:03:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Bing‐Zheng Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jiarui Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guang‐Chao Zhuang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiting Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhen Zhou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Andreas P.

We present a numerically-validated analytical model which predicts both the timescale and the different regimes of stratification restructuring. Applying this model to Earth, we determine that gradual stratification in the deep solid mantle would have been restructured by the early Archean by drainage of low-degree partial melts. This process would leave the early Earth with a depleted deep mantle only slightly denser than the shallow mantle, and a voluminous BMO. The deep solid reservoirs may be relatively easily entrained into the convecting shallow mantle, whereas the BMO could act as a more persistent source of heterogeneity.

Although these magmas are typically modified by crustal assimilation during ascent, key aspects of this process, especially the type and amount of assimilated material and the consequent effects on magma composition, remain poorly constrained, hindering a full understanding of their petrogenesis. Clinopyroxene (Cpx) serves as an ideal archive for deciphering crustal assimilation in such magmatic systems, as it crystallizes over a wide range of melt compositions and is relatively rich in elements that can be used as isotopic tracers (such as Sr). Here, we conduct detailed petrographic studies and in-situ elemental and Sr isotopic analyses along core-to-rim traverses of Cpx from a suite of coeval potassic–ultrapotassic mafic lavas and dikes sampled at six locations of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Two populations of Cpx are identified: phenocrysts and green cores interpreted as recycled crystals from differentiated progenitor magmas related to the host magmas. The phenocryst cores are characterized by high Mg# (up to 90) and elevated Ni and Cr contents, consistent with derivation from primitive mantle-derived melts. Their similarly high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, combined with trace-element systematics, suggest that the primitive melts were derived from a common, slightly enriched lithospheric mantle source metasomatized by carbonate melt-dominated agents. Cpx-based thermobarometry indicates that these magmas ascended through the crust and crystallized at depths corresponding to ~0.2–1.0 GPa, defining a transcrustal plumbing system. Normal core-to-rim zoning in Cpx phenocrysts, as shown by decreasing Mg# and Ni and Cr contents, and increasing incompatible element concentrations (e.g. rare earth elements and Zr), reflects fractional crystallization of Cpx, olivine, and/or phlogopite in the magma plumbing system. Concurrently, systematic increases in initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios from core to rim (up to 0.004) record progressive assimilation of crustal materials with high Sr isotopic ratios. The presence of Neoproterozoic zircon xenocrysts, along with Sr content and isotopic data from regional crustal rocks, identifies Neoproterozoic granitic gneiss as the most likely assimilant. Quantitative models support this interpretation and indicate assimilated wall-rock melt masses of &amp;lt;0.2. Our in-situ micro-analytical data demonstrate that even crustal assimilation to this limited extent can markedly control the isotopic signature of potassic–ultrapotassic mafic magmas in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Given that such magmas significantly contribute to crustal growth by differentiating into voluminous granitoids, this study provides critical insights into how assimilation modulates the isotopic composition of the post-collisional newly-formed crust.

The presence of Neoproterozoic zircon xenocrysts, along with Sr content and isotopic data from regional crustal rocks, identifies Neoproterozoic granitic gneiss as the most likely assimilant. Quantitative models support this interpretation and indicate assimilated wall-rock melt masses of &amp;amp;lt;0.2. Our in-situ micro-analytical data demonstrate that even crustal assimilation to this limited extent can markedly control the isotopic signature of potassic–ultrapotassic mafic magmas in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Given that such magmas significantly contribute to crustal growth by differentiating into voluminous granitoids, this study provides critical insights into how assimilation modulates the isotopic composition of the post-collisional newly-formed crust.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Depth variations in multi-stage hydrogen generation associated with serpentinization in the lower crust and mantle sections of the Oman Ophiolite</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2026.01.055</link><guid>10.1016/j.gca.2026.01.055</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 00:34:58 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kazuki Yoshida</dc:creator><dc:creator>Atsushi Okamoto</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ryosuke Oyanagi</dc:creator><dc:creator>Masakazu Fujii</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kenta K.

This refined framework underscores the indispensable role of magmatic fluids in the mobilization, transport, and deposition of Li in pegmatite systems, advancing genetic models and guiding exploration for rare-metal resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>An abrupt drop in weathering flux amplified the Artinskian Warming Event during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-026-03288-3</link><guid>10.1038/s43247-026-03288-3</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 10:25:33 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Shi Sun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Anqing Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>James G.

This behaviour is observed in classical high-temperature deformation experiments and is a fundamental component of geodynamic models. The latest generation of high-resolution experiments, however, have revealed that materials ranging from metals to ice exhibit a spectrum of behaviours, termed mild-to-wild plasticity, that range from this mild continuous flow to intermittent wild fluctuations in plastic strain rate. Here we show, using nanoindentation experiments, that olivine exhibits measurable wildness, even under conditions at which its behaviour is expected to be relatively mild. Specifically, during experiments on olivine single crystals at room temperature, continuous plastic flow is punctuated by intermittent bursts of displacement with log-normally distributed magnitudes, indicating avalanches of correlated dislocation motion that account for ~8 ± 6% of the plastic strain. The framework of mild-to-wild plasticity predicts that wildness should increase with depth in Earth, with flow of the asthenosphere occurring almost entirely by wild fluctuations of deformation at the grain scale. The recognition of intermittent plasticity in geological materials provides additional constraints on models of dislocation-mediated flow and raises questions about the mechanisms of transient instabilities in otherwise ductile regimes, such as deep earthquakes and slow-slip events.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Flow of Earth’s upper mantle has long been considered to occur by slow, near-continuous creep. This behaviour is observed in classical high-temperature deformation experiments and is a fundamental component of geodynamic models. The latest generation of high-resolution experiments, however, have revealed that materials ranging from metals to ice exhibit a spectrum of behaviours, termed mild-to-wild plasticity, that range from this mild continuous flow to intermittent wild fluctuations in plastic strain rate. Here we show, using nanoindentation experiments, that olivine exhibits measurable wildness, even under conditions at which its behaviour is expected to be relatively mild. Specifically, during experiments on olivine single crystals at room temperature, continuous plastic flow is punctuated by intermittent bursts of displacement with log-normally distributed magnitudes, indicating avalanches of correlated dislocation motion that account for ~8 ± 6% of the plastic strain. The framework of mild-to-wild plasticity predicts that wildness should increase with depth in Earth, with flow of the asthenosphere occurring almost entirely by wild fluctuations of deformation at the grain scale. The recognition of intermittent plasticity in geological materials provides additional constraints on models of dislocation-mediated flow and raises questions about the mechanisms of transient instabilities in otherwise ductile regimes, such as deep earthquakes and slow-slip events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
