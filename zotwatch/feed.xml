Herein, we develop a trace ruthenium anchored self-supported heterostructure (Ru-Ni2P/NF), in which Ni2P accelerates water dissociation to generate hydrogen intermediates and Ru optimizes Hads stabilization. Experimental results indicate 97.5% nitrate conversion with 86.4% NH3 selectivity within 4 h. Furthermore, H-species kinetic analysis and H/D isotopic labeling demonstrate a difference in Hads and •H functionalities; Hads dominates nitrite reduction with a 14.6-fold higher rate constant than •H-mediated pathways. DFT calculations identify Ru-induced symmetry breaking in nitrate (N–O bond elongation: 0.039 Å) as the critical activation step, and a complete deoxygenation–hydrogenation mechanism (*NO3– → *N → *NHx intermediates) is validated by in situ FTIR and Gibbs free energy profiles. Notably, the reduction of nitrite by Ru-Hads is thermodynamically favored without additional potential, which is consistent with the high rate of Hads reduction of nitrite to ammonia in the experiment. This study generates valuable insights into HAT-mediated nitrate conversion at a molecular level, providing a blueprint for catalytic systems in environmental remediation and green ammonia synthesis.

DFT calculations identify Ru-induced symmetry breaking in nitrate (N–O bond elongation: 0.039 Å) as the critical activation step, and a complete deoxygenation–hydrogenation mechanism (*NO3– → *N → *NHx intermediates) is validated by in situ FTIR and Gibbs free energy profiles. Notably, the reduction of nitrite by Ru-Hads is thermodynamically favored without additional potential, which is consistent with the high rate of Hads reduction of nitrite to ammonia in the experiment. This study generates valuable insights into HAT-mediated nitrate conversion at a molecular level, providing a blueprint for catalytic systems in environmental remediation and green ammonia synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Zinc-oligoether carboxylate salts as electrolyte additives for aqueous Zn metal batteries</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67435-8</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-67435-8</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:35:44 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>John Brown</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ivette Aguilar</dc:creator><dc:creator>Juan Forero-Saboya</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chhail Bihari Soni</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hugo Chotard</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yuhuan Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Everett Zuras</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jean-Marc Noël</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jean-Marie Tarascon</dc:creator><dc:creator>Alexis Grimaud</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-67435-8</prism:doi><description>Aqueous zinc-metal batteries, which pair a water-based electrolyte with an earth-abundant metal, offer a sustainable energy storage platform.

The sites contained two ejecta components: a potential spherule (Um Sohryngkew) and Ir‐anomalies. The poorly preserved spherule (~240 μm diameter) exhibited mineral dendrites. At Anjar, two Ir‐anomalies are noted: 8.50 ppb (SGA‐2; ~3.19 m below Flow IV) and 1.16 ppb (SGA‐12). Four Ir‐anomalies are noted at Um Sohryngkew: 1.36 ppb (SMU‐19; 28.44 m from the oldest layer), 3.17 (SMU‐14), 7.00 (SMU‐7), and 1.19 ppb (SMU‐6). Multiple Ir‐anomalies, elevated background‐Ir, and glass shards at both sites highlight a greater influence of Deccan volcanism than previously recognized. Deccan magma‐based Ir‐enrichment is unlikely as such values were not reported in Deccan basalts, but higher Ir‐concentrations in sedimentary layers point to indirect contributions from Deccan outgassing. Thus, the findings of the study underscore the complex interplay of Deccan volcanism and Chicxulub impact across the Indian Subcontinent.

The sites contained two ejecta components: a potential spherule (Um Sohryngkew) and Ir‐anomalies. The poorly preserved spherule (~240 μm diameter) exhibited mineral dendrites. At Anjar, two Ir‐anomalies are noted: 8.50 ppb (SGA‐2; ~3.19 m below Flow IV) and 1.16 ppb (SGA‐12). Four Ir‐anomalies are noted at Um Sohryngkew: 1.36 ppb (SMU‐19; 28.44 m from the oldest layer), 3.17 (SMU‐14), 7.00 (SMU‐7), and 1.19 ppb (SMU‐6). Multiple Ir‐anomalies, elevated background‐Ir, and glass shards at both sites highlight a greater influence of Deccan volcanism than previously recognized. Deccan magma‐based Ir‐enrichment is unlikely as such values were not reported in Deccan basalts, but higher Ir‐concentrations in sedimentary layers point to indirect contributions from Deccan outgassing. Thus, the findings of the study underscore the complex interplay of Deccan volcanism and Chicxulub impact across the Indian Subcontinent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Kinematic Decoupling of Conjugate Faults in the Beijing Plain: Insights From 3D Seismic Reflection Data at the Intersection of the Huangzhuang‐Gaoliying and Nankou‐Sunhe Faults</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025jb031946</link><guid>10.1029/2025jb031946</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:05:55 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Fubing He</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yubin Cui</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mengmeng Cao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shuai Zhao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kai Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wenzhi Niu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiaoyong Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shengli Cao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhiguang Zhou</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1029/2025jb031946</prism:doi><description>Abstract Understanding the architecture and kinematics of intersecting fault systems concealed beneath megacities is crucial for seismic hazard assessment and the mitigation of associated geohazard.

Micro‐Fourier Transform Infrared (μ‐FTIR) spectra collected from phyllosilicate‐rich matrix regions show that band positions of the 3‐μm feature and Si‐O stretch Reststrahlen band (RB) systematically vary with alteration. Additional data from spatially correlated electron microprobe and μ‐FTIR measurements tie spectral variations to specific cation substitutions in serpentines: the 3‐μm feature shifts from 2.78 to 2.70 μm with increased Mg/Fe in octahedral sites, and the Si‐O stretch RB shifts from 10.8 to 9.8 μm with increased Si/Fe 3+ in tetrahedral sites. Co‐variation of these features across the studied CM lithologies defines two successive alteration stages: (1) the Si‐O stretch RB and 3‐μm feature shift to longer and shorter wavelengths, respectively, as Mg‐ and cronstedtite‐rich phyllosilicates form from incipient chondrule alteration; (2) Si‐O stretch RB shifts to shorter wavelengths as Mg‐serpentines replace cronstedtite and Mg‐rich chondrules. These patterns align with inferred changes in composition and redox state for altering fluids on the CM parent body. Similar features in the spectra of C‐type asteroids may reveal information about conditions of aqueous alteration and constrain models of their evolution.

Here we overcome this limitation by combining modeled precipitation δ 18 O time‐series with streamwater δ 18 O data from freshwater pearl mussel shells. Based on more than 2,700 shell‐derived streamwater δ 18 O values reconstructed from four Northern Swedish catchments we estimated contributions of precipitation to streamflow since 1836. The reconstructed δ 18 O streamwater records, which typically capture summer low‐flow conditions during the growing season of the mussels, showed pronounced differences between catchments. In a monitored reference catchment, a negative correlation between baseflow and δ 18 O‐derived contributions of summer precipitation suggests that these differences reflect catchment‐specific variations in baseflow during low‐flow conditions. These variations in seasonal precipitation contributions to streamflow were linked to physiographic catchment characteristics, which also affected long‐term summer low flow conditions. Reconstructions based on bivalve shells therefore provide insights into how landscape features (e.g., catchment size, soil conductivity, lakes) influence water transit times and delay the release of winter precipitation across catchments over centuries. With this transferable and scalable approach, isotope data sets can be extended into pre‐instrumental times, supporting adaptive water‐resource management in data‐scarce regions.

This is a particularly intriguing issue in members of the genus Sulfolobus which encode homologs of a “bacterial-like” candidate segregation machinery, termed SegAB, related to the bacterial ParA-based systems, yet rely on a “eukaryotic-like” ESCRT machinery for cell division. While investigating the temporal dynamics of Sulfolobus chromosome architecture, we uncovered conformational changes at the candidate segregation locus. Loss of the Seg system results in altered nucleoid morphology and induction of a DNA damage response. Significantly, loss of the Seg system also leads to precocious assembly of the key cell division protein CdvA. Finally, we observe interactions between SegA and CdvA, indicating dual roles for the Seg system in effecting chromosome segregation and defining the positioning of the cell division apparatus. Very little is known about the molecular basis of chromosome segregation in archaea. Here, the authors describe conformational changes in the chromosome during the cell cycle of the archaeon Sulfolobus. The changes depend on candidate chromosome segregation proteins that interact with the cell division machinery.

&lt;p&gt;Despite its fundamental importance for the propagation of all cellular life, very little is known about the molecular basis of chromosome segregation in archaea. This is a particularly intriguing issue in members of the genus Sulfolobus which encode homologs of a “bacterial-like” candidate segregation machinery, termed SegAB, related to the bacterial ParA-based systems, yet rely on a “eukaryotic-like” ESCRT machinery for cell division. While investigating the temporal dynamics of Sulfolobus chromosome architecture, we uncovered conformational changes at the candidate segregation locus. Loss of the Seg system results in altered nucleoid morphology and induction of a DNA damage response. Significantly, loss of the Seg system also leads to precocious assembly of the key cell division protein CdvA. Finally, we observe interactions between SegA and CdvA, indicating dual roles for the Seg system in effecting chromosome segregation and defining the positioning of the cell division apparatus. Very little is known about the molecular basis of chromosome segregation in archaea. Here, the authors describe conformational changes in the chromosome during the cell cycle of the archaeon Sulfolobus. The changes depend on candidate chromosome segregation proteins that interact with the cell division machinery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Unsteady Sedimentary Dynamics Enhance the Nutrient Regeneration in the Large‐River Delta‐Front Estuary</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025jc022845</link><guid>10.1029/2025jc022845</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 07:35:23 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Zeyun Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guodong Song</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jin Huang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhuoyi Zhu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Dongdong Zhu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sumei Liu</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1029/2025jc022845</prism:doi><description>Abstract Sediments characterized by unsteady dynamics, such as mobile muds (MM), are commonly found in large‐river delta‐front estuaries (LDEs).

Here, we measured porewater nutrients, total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in sediments of the East China Sea Mobile‐muds (ECSMM) and the adjacent shelf. An unsteady‐state model was developed to simulate the nutrient regeneration under high intensity of reworking. For unsteady stations, promoted benthic nutrient fluxes were −0.11 ± 0.16, 1.30 ± 1.04, 0.04 ± 0.02, and 1.78 ± 0.58 mmol m −2 d −1 for NO 3 − NH 4 + , PO 4 3− , and Si(OH) 4 , respectively. On average, the DIN and Si(OH) 4 fluxes of unsteady stations are approximately 3 times those at steady stations, while PO 4 3− fluxes could reach 8 times. These results revealed that ECSMM is an important nutrient source, and regenerated nutrients could sustain &gt;10% of the local primary production. Furthermore, rapid nutrient regeneration in other major LDEs is estimated through published data. The highest fluxes are found in the Amazon Estuary with the thickest unsteady layer and the most intense reworking. Our work underscores the critical role of unsteady sediment deposition dynamics in global ocean nutrient biogeochemical cycles.

It is critically dependent on ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster containing protein that acts as an electron shuttle. FDX1 reduces ionophore-bound Cu(II) to Cu(I), thereby triggering its release, and promotes mitochondrial protein lipoylation, which is directly targeted by the released copper to drive cell death. Despite the pivotal role of FDX1 in cuproptosis, the structural determinants underlying its distinct functions remain unclear. To address this, we performed deep mutational scanning on FDX1 and find that two conserved solvent-exposed residues, D136 and D139, on alpha helix 3 are essential for both cuproptosis and lipoylation. Charge-reversal mutations at these positions abolish FDX1’s ability to induce cuproptosis and support lipoylation in cells, despite retaining full enzymatic activity in vitro. Guided by structural and genomic analyses, we further identify dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), the E3 subunit of lipoylated complexes as an alternative FDX1 reductase both in cells and in vitro. Together, these findings establish the acidic alpha helix 3 of FDX1 as a critical interface for its upstream regulation and suggest that FDX1’s roles in cuproptosis and in lipoylation are both structurally and functionally linked.
