In this work, authors discover that the strong local fields related to a metasurface high-Q resonances can modify the effective nonlinear response and enable the generation of high harmonics following non-integer-power laws.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Increased small impactor flux on the Moon as inferred from regolith thickness at the Chang’E-5 Region</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67402-3</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-67402-3</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 10:02:05 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Mingwei Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bojun Jia</dc:creator><dc:creator>Vincent R.

Based on this, they infer an increased small impactor for this area, being about 1.2-1.6 times higher than previously estimated.

Herein, we report two atomically precise monocarboxylate-protected superatomic silver nanoclusters (RCO2-AgNCs), formulated as {Ag16(RCO2)12[(4-ClPh)3P]8}2+ [where R = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl (2,4,6-Me3Ph) for Ma or 9-anthracenyl (9-An) for Mb], which features similar chemical composition, identical inner core while distinct interfacial coordination structures. When the RCO2-AgNCs undergoes a transition from an unlocked periphery ligand shell to a locked one, it evolves from exhibiting no luminescent properties at room temperature to possessing such properties. Photoluminescence and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopies demonstrate that remarkable emission property of Ma is ascribed to the highly efficient energy transfer process occurring between phosphine ligand and metallic kernel, in conjunction with the suppression of molecular vibration imposed by the locked shell. This study not only elucidates the correlations between interfacial structure and photoluminescence properties of RCO2-AgNCs but also provides insights for designing nano-optical devices with atomic precision. Tuning the interfacial structure of silver nanoclusters via steric hindrance modulates their photoluminescence. Locking the ligand shell endows the clusters with room-temperature photoluminescence, thereby enabling atomic-level design of optical devices.

Herein, we report two atomically precise monocarboxylate-protected superatomic silver nanoclusters (RCO2-AgNCs), formulated as {Ag16(RCO2)12[(4-ClPh)3P]8}2+ [where R = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl (2,4,6-Me3Ph) for Ma or 9-anthracenyl (9-An) for Mb], which features similar chemical composition, identical inner core while distinct interfacial coordination structures. When the RCO2-AgNCs undergoes a transition from an unlocked periphery ligand shell to a locked one, it evolves from exhibiting no luminescent properties at room temperature to possessing such properties. Photoluminescence and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopies demonstrate that remarkable emission property of Ma is ascribed to the highly efficient energy transfer process occurring between phosphine ligand and metallic kernel, in conjunction with the suppression of molecular vibration imposed by the locked shell. This study not only elucidates the correlations between interfacial structure and photoluminescence properties of RCO2-AgNCs but also provides insights for designing nano-optical devices with atomic precision. Tuning the interfacial structure of silver nanoclusters via steric hindrance modulates their photoluminescence. Locking the ligand shell endows the clusters with room-temperature photoluminescence, thereby enabling atomic-level design of optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Geologically constrained data-driven modeling for mineral prospectivity mapping</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1130/g53947.1</link><guid>10.1130/g53947.1</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:04:32 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Luoqi Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tianyi Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sensen Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jie Yang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yanhua Hu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Linshu Hu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yijun Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>YunZhao Ge</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yunfeng Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Can Rao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhenhong Du</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Geology</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1130/g53947.1</prism:doi><description>The discovery and development of mineral resources are critical for sustaining modern energy demands.

However, the advancement of both fundamental studies and practical applications has been hindered by challenges in synthesizing high-quality, large-area materials. In this work, we report the epitaxial growth of wafer-scale 2D superconducting TMDC single-crystal multilayers by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Our NbS2 multilayer films achieve high wafer-scale uniformity and single crystallinity of 2H phase, as confirmed by AFM, Raman spectroscopy, SHG mapping, LEED and STEM measurements. This is enabled by a dual-precursor strategy that drives self-templated concurrent epitaxy on lattice-matched sapphire, which is further supported by a kinetic growth model. Devices fabricated from the NbS2 film demonstrate superconductivity below a transition temperature of 3 K, consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type superconducting phase transition, with an impressive yield of 95.1% and a resistance variation of only 12%. Additionally, we demonstrate the wafer-scale growth of superconducting NbSe2 films (Tc = 5 K) via MOCVD. Our work underscores a versatile and scalable approach for synthesizing wafer-scale 2D superconductor single crystals, which is essential for their integration into next-generation TMDC-based electronic devices. Metallic 2D transition metal dichalcogenides are appealing for their practical applications and fundamental properties, but their large-scale synthesis remains challenging. Here, the authors report a dual-precursor metal–organic chemical vapor deposition strategy to grow superconducting single-crystalline NbS2 and NbSe2 multilayers at the wafer scale.

&lt;p&gt;Metallic two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are garnering significant attention for their ability to enhance device performance when used as 2D contacts with semiconducting 2D materials, as well as for their intriguing low-temperature properties, including superconductivity, magnetism, and charge density waves (CDWs). However, the advancement of both fundamental studies and practical applications has been hindered by challenges in synthesizing high-quality, large-area materials. In this work, we report the epitaxial growth of wafer-scale 2D superconducting TMDC single-crystal multilayers by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Our NbS2 multilayer films achieve high wafer-scale uniformity and single crystallinity of 2H phase, as confirmed by AFM, Raman spectroscopy, SHG mapping, LEED and STEM measurements. This is enabled by a dual-precursor strategy that drives self-templated concurrent epitaxy on lattice-matched sapphire, which is further supported by a kinetic growth model. Devices fabricated from the NbS2 film demonstrate superconductivity below a transition temperature of 3 K, consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type superconducting phase transition, with an impressive yield of 95.1% and a resistance variation of only 12%. Additionally, we demonstrate the wafer-scale growth of superconducting NbSe2 films (Tc = 5 K) via MOCVD. Our work underscores a versatile and scalable approach for synthesizing wafer-scale 2D superconductor single crystals, which is essential for their integration into next-generation TMDC-based electronic devices. Metallic 2D transition metal dichalcogenides are appealing for their practical applications and fundamental properties, but their large-scale synthesis remains challenging. Here, the authors report a dual-precursor metal–organic chemical vapor deposition strategy to grow superconducting single-crystalline NbS2 and NbSe2 multilayers at the wafer scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Synthesis, structural characterization, and reactivity of homocatenated Ga₄ complexes with unsaturated Ga–Ga=Ga–Ga chains</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67892-1</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-67892-1</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:14:03 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ning Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bing Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yanliang Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wenhao Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shuxia Zhu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Linfang Lu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhigang Ni</dc:creator><dc:creator>Di Wu</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-67892-1</prism:doi><description>The homocatenation of electron-deficient Group 13 metals to form metal-metal multiple bonds through covalent self-assembly remains extremely challenging. Herein we demonstrate the synthesis and characterizations of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-stabilized digallyl digallenes (1a and 1b), which exhibit unsaturated Ga-Ga=Ga-Ga chains with trans-bent geometries. These compounds were synthesized through salt-metathesis reactions using Cp*Ga, (L1)K2/(L2)Li2, and 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene (IiPr). Employing both experimental and computational techniques, our investigation reveals that the chain elongation of 1a was initiated by the in-situ generation of a gallium(I) carbene analog [(L1)GaK]. Additionally, the reactivity of compound 1a with I2, PhS-SPh, Ph3P = S, and Ph2C = O was explored, leading to the formation of tetra-gallium subhalides (4), disulfide addition product (5), a gallium thiirane analog (6), and a [2 + 2] cycloaddition product (7), respectively.

The study provides a comprehensive inventory of global mining footprints, finding that mining causes higher deforestation than previously estimated, with half linked to unrecorded activities, and highlighting the underestimated environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Evidence for landslides triggered by impact events on Ceres</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-025-03119-x</link><guid>10.1038/s43247-025-03119-x</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 08:25:52 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Marco Emanuele Discenza</dc:creator><dc:creator>Maria Teresa Brunetti</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lisa Molaro</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mariacarmela Minnillo</dc:creator><dc:creator>Goro Komatsu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Enrico Miccadei</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Communications Earth &amp;amp; Environment</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s43247-025-03119-x</prism:doi><description>Abstract Triggering mechanisms are a fundamental aspect of landslide studies, as they directly influence both the characteristics of landslides and the environments in which they occur.

The attempts at its resolution shed light on the physical properties and processes controlling earthquake triggering. The recent surge in earthquake data and advancement in detection techniques provide an opportunity to revisit this problem. We utilize a 40‐year Southern California Seismic Network catalog and a 10‐year Quake Template Matching catalog to explore the tidal modulation in Southern California. Results indicate that the correlations between earthquakes and tides vary with location. Regions where seismicity is significantly modulated by tidal stresses have relatively low effective background normal stress (20–155 kPa), which are primarily associated with geothermal locations. Additionally, deeper earthquakes in certain areas have a stronger correlation with tides. These phenomena suggest that faults with lower effective background stress might be more sensitive to tidal modulation. Furthermore, earthquakes of specific types (strike‐slip and thrust) in certain areas are more likely to correlate with tides, suggesting that different fault types experience different tidal loading amplitudes. Our study suggests that earthquake catalogs covering longer time spans with smaller completeness magnitude are required for more robust tidal modulation analysis, and the modulation of seismicity by tides provides a probe to measure the effective background normal stress on the faults at depth.
