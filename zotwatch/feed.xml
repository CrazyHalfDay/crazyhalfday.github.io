This defines a distinct Ba isotopic lightening trend across the arc, reflecting progressive Ba isotopic fractionation associated with enhanced phengite dehydration at increasing subduction depths. The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts. We propose that subducted oceanic crust plays a role similar to that of subducted sediments in recycling FME, such as K, Rb, and Ba, owing to the buffering effect of phengite. Nevertheless, it potentially contributes more significantly to Sr enrichment within the mantle wedge of subduction zones.

We identify seven individually contiguous chemical provinces, nearly exclusively in the highlands. We then conduct geochemical analysis coupled with first order petrological modeling to assess the histories for individually delineated provinces. We identified two new regions where one is consistent with minimal chemical weathering and represents a ∼3.7 Ga old crustal block preserving compositional evidence of fractional crystallization, suggestive of Mars&amp;#x27;s primary crust sequestering early as a magma ocean solidified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
