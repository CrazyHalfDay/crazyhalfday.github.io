Martian geomorphology provides evidence of ancient groundwater activity, but confirmation of present-day liquid water remains limited. Here, we infer near-surface brines confined to meter-scale depths in regions north of about 30 °N in the northern hemisphere, based on the analysis of seasonal variations in marsquake seismicity and thermal modeling. The absence of seasonal marsquakes during colder periods and their abrupt resurgence in warmer seasons can be explained by ice-to-brine phase transitions. Our findings reveal a mechanism whereby seasonal melting of subsurface ice elevates pore pressure and lubricates faults, leading to a reduction in frictional strength, and ultimately inducing marsquakes. This mechanism accounts for the seasonal variation, clustering, high seismic b-values, and shallow focal depths of seasonal marsquakes. Additionally, we estimate that the melting point of briny ice on Mars is below approximately 250 ± 13 K, advancing our understanding of Mars’ present-day brine cycle and near-surface hydrological processes. The study finds that seasonal marsquake patterns may indicate active near-surface brines on Mars today. By connecting seismicity changes to ice-to-brine melting, it infers that shallow liquid water continues to operate beneath the surface and influence Martian fault activity.

Thus, understanding the rheological behavior of minerals, preferentially at a micro‐scale to allow process‐based upscaling, has broad applications across the Earth sciences. Cracks, dislocations, and point defects are microscale agents of deformation that govern the macro‐scale response of rocks under stress. Complexity in deformation behavior arises from the interplay among these defect types. Here, we deformed calcite single crystals under uniaxial loading to study defect dynamics using an array of piezo‐sensors synchronized with fast‐camera recordings. We demonstrate that brittle cracking co‐occurs with crystal‐plastic twinning deformation. Furthermore, each mechanism produces distinct impulsive ultrasonic signals. Cracking produces energetic signals often with high‐frequency patterns. Meanwhile, mechanical twinning produces less energetic, shorter duration, low‐frequency signals correlated with propagating twin fronts. These signals can be fit with a second derivative of a Gaussian function for the first few cycles after their onset. Our results illustrate key microscale processes that drive permanent deformation in calcite, and thus contribute to building an experimentally based, process‐driven understanding of rheological behavior. We highlight the utility of using ultrasonic signals, with detailed time‐series analysis, to help infer in situ microscale deformation at a range of spatiotemporal scales.

Complexity in deformation behavior arises from the interplay among these defect types. Here, we deformed calcite single crystals under uniaxial loading to study defect dynamics using an array of piezo‐sensors synchronized with fast‐camera recordings. We demonstrate that brittle cracking co‐occurs with crystal‐plastic twinning deformation. Furthermore, each mechanism produces distinct impulsive ultrasonic signals. Cracking produces energetic signals often with high‐frequency patterns. Meanwhile, mechanical twinning produces less energetic, shorter duration, low‐frequency signals correlated with propagating twin fronts. These signals can be fit with a second derivative of a Gaussian function for the first few cycles after their onset. Our results illustrate key microscale processes that drive permanent deformation in calcite, and thus contribute to building an experimentally based, process‐driven understanding of rheological behavior. We highlight the utility of using ultrasonic signals, with detailed time‐series analysis, to help infer in situ microscale deformation at a range of spatiotemporal scales.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Oxygen-modulated engineering of Cu0–Cu+ interfaces for CO2-to-C2H4 photoreduction</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67844-9</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-67844-9</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:45:30 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Yuqi Ren</dc:creator><dc:creator>Miao Cheng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hongbin He</dc:creator><dc:creator>Changjun You</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lunbo Duan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhenkun Sun</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ruoxuan Peng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yuan-Hao Zhu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hongyang Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jiancheng Zhou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kai Huang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jie Guan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Naixu Li</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-67844-9</prism:doi><description>CO2-to-hydrocarbon fuel conversion via artificial photosynthesis is limited by catalyst poisoning under high O2 partial pressures and sluggish C2-product formation.

Replacing both electrodes with intercalation hosts provides a solution, but progress is slowed by the lack of a universal principle for selecting kinetically compatible pairs. Most existing efforts optimize single components rather than addressing the electrodes’ kinetic mismatch governing full-cell stability. Here we show a machine-learning-assisted kinetic-matching framework that quantitatively evaluates ion-transport compatibility in intercalation-type zinc-ion batteries electrodes. By correlating interlayer spacing with Zn2+ diffusion behavior, the model introduces two descriptors predicting synchronized ion flux for rational electrode pairing.

&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries offer inherent safety and low cost, yet performance is limited by unstable zinc metal negative electrodes and dissolution-prone positive electrodes, causing dendrite growth, sluggish ion transport, and rapid capacity decay. Replacing both electrodes with intercalation hosts provides a solution, but progress is slowed by the lack of a universal principle for selecting kinetically compatible pairs. Most existing efforts optimize single components rather than addressing the electrodes’ kinetic mismatch governing full-cell stability. Here we show a machine-learning-assisted kinetic-matching framework that quantitatively evaluates ion-transport compatibility in intercalation-type zinc-ion batteries electrodes. By correlating interlayer spacing with Zn2+ diffusion behavior, the model introduces two descriptors predicting synchronized ion flux for rational electrode pairing. Using this framework, an optimized Zn3V3O8 | |NH4V4O10 system achieves a specific capacity of 310 mAh g-1 and retains over 12,000 cycles at 5 A g-1.

Near the FeTe limit, the surface state disappears due to an electron-correlation-driven topological transition associated with decoherence of the dxy-orbital-derived bands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>A Data-Driven Integration of Pore Geometry and Aspect Ratio into Rock Physics Models for Porosity Partitioning and Elastic Property Estimation in Carbonate Reservoirs</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1190/geo-2025-0480</link><guid>10.1190/geo-2025-0480</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 12:42:44 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Eliane Petersohn</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guilherme Pena Castilho</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tapan Mukerji</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Geophysics</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1190/geo-2025-0480</prism:doi><description>Abstract Carbonate reservoirs exhibit complex, heterogeneous pore systems, with pore shapes and sizes spanning nanoscale to meter scale due to primary and secondary porosity, varied fabrics, and textures.

Recently, an analytical model for squirt flow in wedge-shaped cracks connected to a stiff pore was developed to investigate wave dispersion and attenuation in isotropic porous rocks. To validate this model, we conducted three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of squirt flow using the finite element method (FEM). The numerical results revealed a significant discrepancy between the published analytical and the present numerical solutions. After modifying the published analytical model, the updated analytical solution showed a good agreement with the numerical solution. We also analyzed how wedge-shaped crack aperture and crack geometry affect the attenuation and dispersion responses. The results demonstrate that, using an equivalent crack aperture, the penny-shaped crack geometry serves as a physically consistent substitute for the wedge-shaped geometry. Furthermore, in numerical simulations of squirt flow, employing penny-shaped geometries presents great advantages compared to using wedge-shaped geometries due to the heavier discretization requirements of the latter.

Pregnant rats were exposed to 14C-labeled 20 nm or 100 nm PS NPs (PS20 or PS100) via oral gavage, intratracheal aerosolization, or intravenous injection, and tissue distribution and excretion were determined by radioactivity measurements. We found that PS NPs were exclusively excreted through faeces, irrespective of the exposure routes, without urinary elimination.

This study establishes the most comprehensive and reliable quantitative profile of PS NP biodistribution in mammals to date, revealing distinct size-dependent translocation patterns that provide a robust foundation for evaluating their health impacts. Previous studies on biodistribution of microplastics showed discrepancies. This study provides quantitative data to date on how nanoplastics distribute and eliminate from the body using carbon-14-radiolabelled particles in rats.

Given the prevalence of cased boreholes in oil fields, it is of great significance to investigate the reflections under the condition of cased boreholes for far-field reflector detection. However, simulating wavefields for cased single-well imaging remains challenging. Instead of using the conventional finite-difference method which is considerably time-consuming, we proposed an efficient analytical method for simulating reflections by incorporating viscous linear-slip conditions, thus providing a reliable tool for characterizing the reflections in realistic scenarios involving imperfectly bonded interfaces. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through comparisons with reference solutions. Based on the proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical experiments to analyze the influence of the interface stiffness and viscosity on reflections. We find that the amplitudes of reflections initially increase and then decrease as the interface stiffness decreases for dipole sources, highlighting the advantage of using dipole sources in scenarios involving poor cement bonding quality. However, for monopole sources, the reflection amplitudes decrease nearly monotonically with decreasing stiffnesses. Additionally, for both dipole and monopole sources, the reflection characteristics are dominated by the interface stiffness rather than the viscosity in the case of large stiffness (i.e., good cement bonding). However, the reflections become highly sensitive to the interface viscosity when the stiffness is small (i.e., poor cement bonding). Consequently, the proposed method serves as a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing the reflections in cased single-well imaging with imperfectly bonded interfaces, providing a theoretical guidance for developing advanced logging equipment in oil/gas field exploration.

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations quantitatively revealed riverine organic carbon (OC riverine ) dominated POC posttyphoon (44.8%), followed by marine OC (OC marine ) (35.0%), while deltaic organic carbon (OC deltaic ) was least (20.3%) in LZB. Under nontyphoon conditions, OC deltaic dominated (46.0%) with OC riverine being minimal (25.0%). Both δ 13 C and C/N ratio analyses showed that posttyphoon POM sources included freshwater algae, soil organic carbon, C3 plants, and marine POC, while nontyphoon POM primarily derived from freshwater algae and marine POC. Molecular indicators suggested that typhoon‐driven terrestrial inputs of labile organic matter enhanced POM degradation via the priming effect. Consequently, POM degradation was more extensive posttyphoon, transforming the coastal region from a carbon sink to a carbon source. These disturbances likely reduce carbon burial in marine sediments during extreme weather events.
