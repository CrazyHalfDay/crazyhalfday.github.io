However, direct imaging of magma distribution and connectivity from the Moho to the surface remains rare. Changbaishan-Tianchi volcano, known for one of the Earth’s largest explosive eruptions, has recently undergone repeated magmatic unrest. To investigate the magmatic system beneath Tianchi volcano, we invert magnetotelluric data to image its three-dimensional resistivity structure, revealing a vertically extensive low-resistivity anomaly system spanning the entire crust. This system comprises three compositionally distinct, vertically connected melt reservoirs: a broad lower-crustal basaltic reservoir (20–35 km), an upper-crustal trachytic reservoir (5–10 km), and an uppermost comenditic reservoir (2–3.5 km). Estimated melt fractions are 2.1–3.7%, 7.0–16.3%, and 18.8–23.8%, respectively. Our results suggest progressive upward magma transfer among these reservoirs via well-resolved conductive pathways, consistent with recent episodes of unrest. Notably, melt volume in the lower crust is about one to two orders of magnitude greater than in the upper crust, a pattern also observed at Yellowstone and likely applicable to active volcanic systems at both divergent and convergent plate boundaries. These findings suggest that deep crustal hot zones may fundamentally control shallow melt volumes and thus the eruptive capacity of polygenetic volcanoes. Deep crustal melt accumulation controls the shallow melt volumes and hence the eruptive capacity of polygenetic volcanoes, according to geophysical and petrological analysis.

These findings mark a major milestone for submillimeter astronomy at Dome A and offer valuable insights into the impact of massive star feedback on the surrounding ISM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Dynamic oxygen vacancy engineering on CuO via refreshable catalytic surface for high-efficient water decontamination</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-68180-8</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-68180-8</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 18:24:55 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Xinyi Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Liangjie Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jian Wei</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhuang Guo</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xinyao Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lijie Duan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Huazhang Zhao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yonghui Song</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-68180-8</prism:doi><description>Oxygen vacancies (Ov) on metal oxide surfaces exhibit high catalytic activity for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in wastewater decontamination, yet their in-situ regeneration remains a significant challenge.

Our models show that slabs of all geometries can destabilize the TBL, initiating secondary plumes ahead of and behind the slab. All plumes are deflected by the slab‐induced mantle flow and a sinking slab may even suppress plumes beneath it. However, a higher TBL temperature and a longer pre‐subduction heating duration may increase buoyancy flux of secondary plumes, making them more resistant to slab‐driven flow. Under all conditions explored in this study, the strength of secondary plumes produced in our models is comparable to that of the Eifel plume. This paper elucidates slab‐plume interaction and their impact on intraplate volcanism with applications to the Eifel, Massif Central and Hainan volcanic areas.

Here, we estimate the amounts of sediment and organic carbon disturbed and relocated in the North Sea resulting from (1) dredging in the form of mineral aggregate extraction and (2) material dumping during waterway maintenance. We show that despite disturbing less sediment than aggregate extraction, dumping causes greater carbon disturbance. We estimate carbon disturbance by both activities to be higher than by marine construction, but lower than by bottom-contacting fisheries.

Globally, dumping of organic carbon is estimated to 0.09–0.46 GtC yr −1 , and disturbance by material extraction to 0.04−0.08 GtC yr −1 .

&lt;p&gt;Abstract The disturbance and relocation of coastal sediments by human activities constitutes a potentially large disruption to natural sediment and organic carbon fluxes, but large-scale estimates of these impacts are lacking. Here, we estimate the amounts of sediment and organic carbon disturbed and relocated in the North Sea resulting from (1) dredging in the form of mineral aggregate extraction and (2) material dumping during waterway maintenance. We show that despite disturbing less sediment than aggregate extraction, dumping causes greater carbon disturbance. We estimate carbon disturbance by both activities to be higher than by marine construction, but lower than by bottom-contacting fisheries. Simulations indicate that most dumped material re-deposits near the coast. Globally, dumping of organic carbon is estimated to 0.09–0.46 GtC yr −1 , and disturbance by material extraction to 0.04−0.08 GtC yr −1 . Comparison to natural processes suggests that these activities should be considered in regional to global sediment and carbon budgets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Inherited Lithospheric Structure Controls Cenozoic Intraplate Basaltic Volcanism in Central Mongolia Due To Mantle Upwelling</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025jb031727</link><guid>10.1029/2025jb031727</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 07:20:18 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Mengfan Jiang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xuewei Bao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tao Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yingkai Wu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kecheng Zhou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xuejing Li</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1029/2025jb031727</prism:doi><description>Abstract The mechanisms responsible for intracontinental basaltic volcanism are not well understood.

Regulating the ASEI crystallographic microstructure offers a promising yet underexplored solution with efficacy uncertainty. Critical issue lies in what is the optimal crystallographic microstructure state. Using the ZnS ASEI in aqueous Zn batteries as a case study, here we report the effects of grain orientation and grain boundary density on the performance of Zn negative electrode. The results reveal the existence of an optimal microstructure state—predominant in-plane (111) orientation coupled with a critical grain boundary density of ~55 μm/μm2—which delivers an 18-fold lifespan extension, and over 3400 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.92% at 5 mA cm-2, surpassing the efficacy of most chemical composition manipulations. Mechanistically, the (111) orientation integrates higher electrochemical kinetics and mechanical strength. As grain boundary density increases to tens of μm/μm2, the enhancement in electrochemical kinetics coincides with compromised mechanical strength, with their trade-off delineating the critical density that maximizes electrode cycling stability.

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of dendrite growth limiting metal battery lifespan, despite extensive chemical composition optimizations for artificial solid electrolyte interphases (ASEIs), necessitates the development of ASEI design routes. Regulating the ASEI crystallographic microstructure offers a promising yet underexplored solution with efficacy uncertainty. Critical issue lies in what is the optimal crystallographic microstructure state. Using the ZnS ASEI in aqueous Zn batteries as a case study, here we report the effects of grain orientation and grain boundary density on the performance of Zn negative electrode. The results reveal the existence of an optimal microstructure state—predominant in-plane (111) orientation coupled with a critical grain boundary density of ~55 μm/μm2—which delivers an 18-fold lifespan extension, and over 3400 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.92% at 5 mA cm-2, surpassing the efficacy of most chemical composition manipulations. Mechanistically, the (111) orientation integrates higher electrochemical kinetics and mechanical strength. As grain boundary density increases to tens of μm/μm2, the enhancement in electrochemical kinetics coincides with compromised mechanical strength, with their trade-off delineating the critical density that maximizes electrode cycling stability. Our findings exemplify an efficient ASEI design route—crystallographic microstructure engineering. Dendrite growth compromises the cycling life of metal batteries. Here, authors propose a crystallographic microstructure engineering approach to the artificial solid electrolyte interphase, demonstrating a high efficacy in stabilizing the zinc metal electrode during plating/stripping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Soft photonic skins with dynamic texture and colour control</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09948-2</link><guid>10.1038/s41586-025-09948-2</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:01:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Siddharth Doshi</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nicholas A.

Ferroelectric polarization, arising from the spontaneous alignment of electric dipoles within materials, provides an alternative strategy to achieve directional ion transport without additional geometry modification or surface functionalization. This work demonstrates that ultrathin freestanding ferroelectric crystalline bismuth ferrite symmetric-type single-nanopore membranes, with a thickness down to 30 nm, exhibit rectified ion currents driven by naturally spontaneous polarization. These nanopores exhibit reversible polarization switching with hysteretic ion current rectification in response to external pH stimuli, offering additional tunability in emulating the functions of biological ion channels. Furthermore, significant osmotic power generation is observed, enabled by current amplification through directional ion transport. These findings highlight the potential of utilizing ultrathin ferroelectric oxide membrane materials as ionic diodes with directional preferences and switchable polarizations for developing ionic circuits, mimicking biological membranes, and facilitating osmotic power conversion. Achieving directional ion transport in thin membranes is desirable yet challenging.

&lt;p&gt;Artificial ionic diodes, inspired by biological ion channels, are typically realized by creating asymmetries in pore geometry or surface charge. Ferroelectric polarization, arising from the spontaneous alignment of electric dipoles within materials, provides an alternative strategy to achieve directional ion transport without additional geometry modification or surface functionalization. This work demonstrates that ultrathin freestanding ferroelectric crystalline bismuth ferrite symmetric-type single-nanopore membranes, with a thickness down to 30 nm, exhibit rectified ion currents driven by naturally spontaneous polarization. These nanopores exhibit reversible polarization switching with hysteretic ion current rectification in response to external pH stimuli, offering additional tunability in emulating the functions of biological ion channels. Furthermore, significant osmotic power generation is observed, enabled by current amplification through directional ion transport. These findings highlight the potential of utilizing ultrathin ferroelectric oxide membrane materials as ionic diodes with directional preferences and switchable polarizations for developing ionic circuits, mimicking biological membranes, and facilitating osmotic power conversion. Achieving directional ion transport in thin membranes is desirable yet challenging.
