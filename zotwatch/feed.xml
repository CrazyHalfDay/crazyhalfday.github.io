Consequently, our results indicate Hg isotopes and the chemical composition and Fe redox states of chlorite can be applied to reveal metal source and mineralization processes in ancient VMS deposits and may also serve as a valuable exploration guide for VMS systems.

Here, we report the first definitive example of polymetamorphism in metapelites of the Baoyintu Group, central Inner Mongolia. Our analyses included petrographic observations, phase equilibrium modelling, as well as U–Pb and Rb–Sr geochronology. Garnet–white mica schist exhibits two stages of garnet growth: an early‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (I) with epidote + phengite + quartz + rutile (I) inclusions and a late‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (II) + muscovite + quartz + ilmenite + staurolite + rutile (II) in the matrix. Phase equilibrium modelling yields pressures of 16–22 kbar and temperatures of 400°C–500°C for the early‐stage assemblage corresponding to blueschist facies metamorphism, and 6–7 kbar and ~550°C for the late‐stage assemblage corresponding to amphibolite facies metamorphism. A garnet–two mica schist contains a mineral assemblage similar to the late‐stage assemblage in garnet–white mica schist, yielding peak pressures of 4–5 kbar and temperatures of 570°C–580°C. Zircon and rutile U–Pb geochronology of the metapelite samples yielded two groups of metamorphic ages (c. 384 and c. 259–236 Ma). In situ mica Rb–Sr geochronology of the garnet‐two mica schist yielded an age of 215 Ma interpreted to record cooling after the Permian–Triassic metamorphic peak temperature. These results reveal that medium‐ and low‐dP/dT metamorphism occurred during the late Permian–early Triassic that overprinted Devonian high‐dP/dT metamorphism. Based on previous studies of magmatism in the region, we relate the two stages of metamorphism to subduction of Paleo‐Asian oceanic lithosphere (Devonian, c. 384 Ma) and back‐arc extension (Permian–Triassic, 259–236 Ma). This contribution fills a critical gap in our understanding of the tectono‐thermal transition history of subduction within the Paleo‐Asian Ocean and provides a robust framework for interpreting polymetamorphism in accretionary orogens.

&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT Understanding metamorphic overprinting is crucial for identifying transitions in tectono‐thermal regimes during orogenesis. Here, we report the first definitive example of polymetamorphism in metapelites of the Baoyintu Group, central Inner Mongolia. Our analyses included petrographic observations, phase equilibrium modelling, as well as U–Pb and Rb–Sr geochronology. Garnet–white mica schist exhibits two stages of garnet growth: an early‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (I) with epidote + phengite + quartz + rutile (I) inclusions and a late‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (II) + muscovite + quartz + ilmenite + staurolite + rutile (II) in the matrix. Phase equilibrium modelling yields pressures of 16–22 kbar and temperatures of 400°C–500°C for the early‐stage assemblage corresponding to blueschist facies metamorphism, and 6–7 kbar and ~550°C for the late‐stage assemblage corresponding to amphibolite facies metamorphism.

To reconstruct primary Na contents of kimberlitic melts, we quantified Na partitioning between olivine and volatile-rich kimberlitic melts (Note: abstract contains math symbols that cannot be translated here; see PDF). Applying this calibration to magmatic olivine from 22 kimberlites yields reconstructed Na2Omelt of 1.9−8.6 wt% (typically ±0.25 wt%) at 1 GPa, showing that magmatic Na contents are much higher than indicated by bulk rock measurements. The lower range of these reconstructed Na2O values aligns with the predicted 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% of asthenospheric carbonated silicate melts generated from typical lherzolitic mantle at 7 GPa. The higher values correspond to the same 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% if recalculated for olivine crystallization at 2−4 GPa. Because Na2O loss through fluid exsolution during kimberlite ascent cannot exceed 0.5 wt%, the extreme Na loss leading to the observed low bulk-kimberlite values must occur upon solidification when copious amounts of Na-rich fluids are expelled. These findings suggest that kimberlitic melts do not require a peculiar mantle source, but rather carbon-bearing fertile lherzolites that melt at adiabatic conditions, placing kimberlites into a broad continuum with primitive alkaline ocean island melts.

In this paper, we use numerical models of continental rifting to investigate whether proximity to cratonic lithosphere enhances the ore-forming potential during rift basin evolution. Our results show that narrow asymmetric and wide rifts respond differently to the presence of close cratonic edges. The potential for metallogenesis in narrow asymmetric rifts decreases with increasing proximity to the craton edge. In contrast, metal source rock area and ore-forming mechanisms increase when wide rifts form close to a craton edge. We attribute these responses to the increased lithospheric strength on the craton-ward side of the rift that determines not only the initial fault geometry, but also the subsequent fault development and migration direction. This modifies the spatial and temporal overlap of the components of the mineral system required for deposit formation, i.e., source rock, fluid-focussing faults, and deposit host rock. The greatest metallogenic potential is found in the narrow margin of narrow asymmetric rifts formed far from a craton edge; here, the largest area of source rock is concentrated in the main border basin. The link between craton edges and metallogenic potential, therefore, is hypothesized to be due to the preferred initialization of rifts next to, and the preferential preservation of deposits on, the edges of stable cratons.

This modifies the spatial and temporal overlap of the components of the mineral system required for deposit formation, i.e., source rock, fluid-focussing faults, and deposit host rock. The greatest metallogenic potential is found in the narrow margin of narrow asymmetric rifts formed far from a craton edge; here, the largest area of source rock is concentrated in the main border basin. The link between craton edges and metallogenic potential, therefore, is hypothesized to be due to the preferred initialization of rifts next to, and the preferential preservation of deposits on, the edges of stable cratons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Petrogenetic Link Between Carbonatite and Silicate rocks in the Wajilitage Carbonatite Complex: Insights from

The lowest ratios, or most negative μ 182 W values when calculated as parts per million variations from an assumed Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) value, correspond with elevated 3 He/ 4 He compositions for some OIB lavas. Possible explanations for these anomalous isotopic compositions include: 1) core-mantle interaction following initial core-mantle separation or 2) early differentiation of the silicate mantle. Elevated 3 He/ 4 He in OIB originates from a less-degassed portion of the mantle, compared to the accessible upper mantle, and has been associated with a moderately depleted mantle component with long-lived radiogenic isotope characteristics intermediate to all known extreme mantle endmembers. This component has commonly been referred to as the “FOcal ZOne” or FOZO. In addition to these characteristics, FOZO has been suggested to have anomalous enrichments in the high field strength elements (HFSE) Ti, Ta, and Nb. Tungsten is a moderately siderophile element that behaves as an HFSE in the silicate Earth, and in some OIB, μ 182 W and Ti, Ta, and Nb enrichments display negative correlations. To further investigate the relation between anomalous μ 182 W, 3 He/ 4 He and Ti, Ta, and Nb enrichments in melts most closely associated with the FOZO mantle source, we analyzed basalts from three intraplate volcanic tracks, Easter-Salas y Gomez, Bowie-Kodiak, and Louisville, for μ 182 W and bulk major and trace elements. The new isotopic data for each hotspot system record μ 182 W values that are within the global range of OIB (Easter-Salas y Gomez μ 182 W = +3 to −17; Bowie-Kodiak μ 182 W = +1 to −12; and Louisville μ 182 W = −1 to −9). To test whether these compositions can be explained by the crystallization of an early basal magma ocean and subsequent long-term isolation of its crystallization products, a simple fractional crystallization model was developed. We find that nearly all isotopic and trace element compositions inferred for the FOZO component can be reproduced by the chemical fractionations produced with this model. Furthermore, the model is consistent with data for additional OIB sampled globally. Finally, our model results also indicate that the Sm/Nd ratio in the inferred FOZO reservoir may not be sufficiently modified by bridgmanite fractionation to generate resolvable μ 142 Nd anomalies in OIB (resulting from decay in the 146 Sm- 142 Nd short-lived system) relative to BSE. This is consistent with the lack of μ 142 Nd anomalies in most OIB, even where negative μ 182 W anomalies are largest. Collectively, these findings indicate that at least some of the anomalous 182 W/ 184 W compositions observed in modern OIB may plausibly originate from a differentiation product of the silicate mantle that formed within the first 60 Ma of Solar System history, and without the need for core-mantle interaction.

While the organic geochemical continuum and evolutionary transitions remain elusive, due to the intense hydrothermal alteration. We apply a metabolomics-inspired molecular fingerprinting strategy integrating mass spectral networking and hierarchical organization, to construct a molecular relatedness phylogenetic tree for vents from ultraslow-spreading Indian Ridge. Here we show that organic molecules from different vent fields and activity states share common molecular connection patterns. The observed progressive molecular evolution from alkanes through aromatics to complex heteroatom-bearing compounds reveals a systematic increase in molecular functionalization and polarity. This finding helps bridge the gap between simple reduced carbon and prebiotic molecular complexity, underscoring the role of hydrothermal systems in shaping life’s essential feedstock on the primordial Earth. This framework may contribute to the search for life-markers on other astrobiological contexts, e.g., Mars, Enceladus, Callisto and Europa.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract Abyssal hydrothermal vents are regarded as reactors for simple reduced carbon transforming into more complex forms of prebiotic organic chemistry. While the organic geochemical continuum and evolutionary transitions remain elusive, due to the intense hydrothermal alteration. We apply a metabolomics-inspired molecular fingerprinting strategy integrating mass spectral networking and hierarchical organization, to construct a molecular relatedness phylogenetic tree for vents from ultraslow-spreading Indian Ridge. Here we show that organic molecules from different vent fields and activity states share common molecular connection patterns. The observed progressive molecular evolution from alkanes through aromatics to complex heteroatom-bearing compounds reveals a systematic increase in molecular functionalization and polarity. This finding helps bridge the gap between simple reduced carbon and prebiotic molecular complexity, underscoring the role of hydrothermal systems in shaping life’s essential feedstock on the primordial Earth.

To this end, textural analyses were undertaken on seventeen representative plutonic xenoliths from St Vincent, and four of these samples (two olivine gabbros, two hornblende-olivine gabbros) were studied in detail via element mapping, mineral trace element analyses and geochemical modelling. The chemical, textural and mineralogical characteristics of the olivine gabbros were best explained via fractional crystallisation in the mid-upper crust (~6–18 km depth). However, the hornblende-olivine gabbros (two of seventeen samples studied) contained clear textural evidence for melt-mush reaction in the mid-upper crust. The trace element compositions of minerals such as clinopyroxene in these two samples were best reproduced via assimilation-fractional crystallisation modelling, simulating melt-mush reactions, supporting the textural evidence. Our plutonic xenoliths reveal that in addition to fractional crystallisation, cryptic (i.e. not directly recorded in lavas) melt-mush reaction processes also contribute to magma chemical evolution, particularly influencing trace elements, within the sub-volcanic plumbing system. Textural evidence for melt-mush reaction is increasingly reported in plutonic xenoliths from other active arcs and exhumed arc crustal sections, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous in mush-dominated arc plumbing systems. Melt-mush reaction therefore represents an important process contributing to arc magma and arc crust trace element chemical diversity.

The Llallagua and Huanuni deposits show significantly heavier Sn isotope compositions (average = 1.24 ± 0.24‰ δ 124 Sn; n = 10) compared to all other deposits (average = 0.56 ± 0.55‰; n = 23) and contain several distinguishing geological attributes including: genetic association with porphyry phase stocks and/or dikes, vapor-rich and moderately to highly saline fluid inclusions, vertically restricted and/or discontinuous high-grade veins, and extensive tourmaline-rich magmatic-hydrothermal breccias. Together, these features are consistent with Rayleigh fractionation and suggest that orthomagmatic fluid separation, fluid boiling, and oxidation contributed to cassiterite precipitation and caused Sn isotope fractionation. The residual fluids after cassiterite precipitation were depleted in heavy Sn isotopes and propagated along district-scale fluid pathways. The Sn isotopic ranges for cassiterite from the Sayaquira (−0.13–1.45‰), Colquiri (0.18–1.44‰), Colcha (0.07–1.47‰), and Monserrat (−0.56–0.93‰) deposits may be a consequence of cassiterite precipitation over longer mineralization length scales with increased meteoric water influx, where distal cassiterite precipitated from hydrothermal ore fluid that was depleted in heavy 124 Sn. The wide and heavy range of Zn isotopic compositions of sphalerite suggests that early orthomagmatic fluid separation and boiling may have caused significant isotopic fractionation during early fluid transport prior to sphalerite precipitation. Subsequent processes including dilution by Sn- and Zn-poor meteoric water and the concomitant change in fluid pH and increase in oxygen fugacity plausibly contributed to the precipitation of isotopically lighter sphalerite at the Monserrat, El Salvador, and Huari Huari deposits

The Llallagua and Huanuni deposits show significantly heavier Sn isotope compositions (average = 1.24 ± 0.24‰ δ 124 Sn; n = 10) compared to all other deposits (average = 0.56 ± 0.55‰; n = 23) and contain several distinguishing geological attributes including: genetic association with porphyry phase stocks and/or dikes, vapor-rich and moderately to highly saline fluid inclusions, vertically restricted and/or discontinuous high-grade veins, and extensive tourmaline-rich magmatic-hydrothermal breccias. Together, these features are consistent with Rayleigh fractionation and suggest that orthomagmatic fluid separation, fluid boiling, and oxidation contributed to cassiterite precipitation and caused Sn isotope fractionation. The residual fluids after cassiterite precipitation were depleted in heavy Sn isotopes and propagated along district-scale fluid pathways. The Sn isotopic ranges for cassiterite from the Sayaquira (−0.13–1.45‰), Colquiri (0.18–1.44‰), Colcha (0.07–1.47‰), and Monserrat (−0.56–0.93‰) deposits may be a consequence of cassiterite precipitation over longer mineralization length scales with increased meteoric water influx, where distal cassiterite precipitated from hydrothermal ore fluid that was depleted in heavy 124 Sn. The wide and heavy range of Zn isotopic compositions of sphalerite suggests that early orthomagmatic fluid separation and boiling may have caused significant isotopic fractionation during early fluid transport prior to sphalerite precipitation. Subsequent processes including dilution by Sn- and Zn-poor meteoric water and the concomitant change in fluid pH and increase in oxygen fugacity plausibly contributed to the precipitation of isotopically lighter sphalerite at the Monserrat, El Salvador, and Huari Huari deposits&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Continental Weathering as Climate Stabilizer</title><link>https://doi.org/10.2138/gselements.22.1.24</link><guid>10.2138/gselements.22.1.24</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:11:35 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Gaojun Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gen K.
