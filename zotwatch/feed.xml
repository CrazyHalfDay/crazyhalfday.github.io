Mechanochemical dechlorination of PVC produces waste chlorides that remain largely unutilized. Herein, we demonstrate that contact-electro-catalysis-mediated dechlorination, in tandem with alcohol chlorination can enable the upcycling of PVC to produce value-added organic chlorides and enhance atomic efficiency. Anatase TiO2, as contact-electro-catalyst, mediates the single electron transfer process that promotes the dechlorination of PVC under ball milling, thereby enabling the cascade alcohol chlorination through in-situ generated HCl. This strategy is applicable to a variety of benzylic, alicyclic, aliphatic and heterocyclic alcohols, yielding the corresponding organic chlorides with yields up to 95% in 4 hours. This mechanochemical approach can be scaled up to a 40 g scale of PVC and applied to real PVC samples. Structural analysis confirms the effective degradation of PVC accompanied by dechlorination with molecular weight decreasing from 65.0 kDa to 4.6 kDa after five cycles. This mechanochemical approach opens avenues for the application of PVC as a convenient and safe chlorine source in chemical transformations. The mechanochemical dechlorination of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) can catalyse reactions through the release of chlorides. Here, the authors use TiO2 as a contact-electro-catalyst to achieve PVC dechlorination via ball-milling for the solvent-free, mechanochemical chlorination of alcohols.

&lt;p&gt;Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has raised significant environment concerns due to its chlorine-rich composition. Mechanochemical dechlorination of PVC produces waste chlorides that remain largely unutilized. Herein, we demonstrate that contact-electro-catalysis-mediated dechlorination, in tandem with alcohol chlorination can enable the upcycling of PVC to produce value-added organic chlorides and enhance atomic efficiency. Anatase TiO2, as contact-electro-catalyst, mediates the single electron transfer process that promotes the dechlorination of PVC under ball milling, thereby enabling the cascade alcohol chlorination through in-situ generated HCl. This strategy is applicable to a variety of benzylic, alicyclic, aliphatic and heterocyclic alcohols, yielding the corresponding organic chlorides with yields up to 95% in 4 hours. This mechanochemical approach can be scaled up to a 40 g scale of PVC and applied to real PVC samples. Structural analysis confirms the effective degradation of PVC accompanied by dechlorination with molecular weight decreasing from 65.0 kDa to 4.6 kDa after five cycles. This mechanochemical approach opens avenues for the application of PVC as a convenient and safe chlorine source in chemical transformations. The mechanochemical dechlorination of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) can catalyse reactions through the release of chlorides. Here, the authors use TiO2 as a contact-electro-catalyst to achieve PVC dechlorination via ball-milling for the solvent-free, mechanochemical chlorination of alcohols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Peptide-functionalized membrane camouflage for endogenous H2S-induced photothermal immunotherapy of orthotopic colorectal cancer</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-65876-9</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-65876-9</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 09:33:23 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kai Cheng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fang Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jia-Hua Zou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiao-Ling Lei</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xiao-Ting Xie</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yan-Bin Guo</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guo-Ping Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bo Liu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yuan-Di Zhao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jiang Xia</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jin-Xuan Fan</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-65876-9</prism:doi><description>Abstract The significant challenges pose by the high recurrence and metastasis rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) persist in its diagnosis and treatment.

Taken together, PfCC represents a potential anti-cancer therapy for CRC with the combined effect of immune-regulation and the regulation of the gut flora.

Thermal analysis and synchrotron powder diffraction reveal that ulexite, NaCaB5O6(OH)6·5H2O, loses two H2O molecules at 100 °C, causing the formation of a stable three-hydrated phase that retains the fundamental building block (FBB) observed in ulexite.

The dehydrated ulexite is stable up to 160 °C. Our findings not only resolve longstanding ambiguities regarding the nature of the so-called one-hydrated phase but also suggest the possibility that dehydrated ulexite naturally emerges as a stable hydrated borate mineral. New insights into the thermal behaviors and dehydration mechanisms of hydrated borate minerals have implications for both natural mineralization processes and industrial applications.

Comparing the model predictions and the observations determine, for the first time, that depth‐averaged turbulent viscosity during Dead Sea storms is of order of 10 −3 m 2 s −1 . Resuspension of bottom clay to fine sand is governed primarily by waves inducing shear stress three orders of magnitude larger than current‐induced shear stress, a ratio which is rather constant during Dead Sea storms.

Additionally, we highlight the importance of wave‐induced resuspension as an additional source of sediment involved in the formation of thin, muddy layers that are traditionally interpreted as indicators of inflowing sediment plumes. The novelty of the manuscript lies in the combination of rare observations and modeling, which provides comprehensive physics of the studied processes, an approach that can be used in other nearshore environments of lakes or oceans.

Leveraging the obligate co-expression of CD8αβ required for class-I TCR function in CD4 T cells, we identify CD8β as a tractable site for engineering without loss of function. In vitro screening demonstrates incorporation of the CD28 intracellular tail, yielding a CD8/CD28 chimeric co-receptor, most effectively enhances cytokine production, T cell persistence, and tumor control in immunodeficient murine models while preserving stem-like transcriptional features compared to native CD8β. Further rational modification of the CD28 binding motifs improves tumor control in vivo with increased intratumoral accumulation and reduced exhaustion. This benefit also extends to PRAME and WT1-specific TCRs in vitro supporting generalizability. TCR-engineered T cells have shown limited efficacy in part due to the absence of co-stimulation leading to limited accumulation in solid tumors. The authors here show engineering the CD8β coreceptor with an intracellular CD28 domain enhances cytokine production, persistence, and tumor control in vivo independent of tumor-associated co-stimulatory ligand encounter.

To enhance function downstream of TCR signaling, here we investigate the adaptability of TCR components to synthetic modification. Leveraging the obligate co-expression of CD8αβ required for class-I TCR function in CD4 T cells, we identify CD8β as a tractable site for engineering without loss of function. In vitro screening demonstrates incorporation of the CD28 intracellular tail, yielding a CD8/CD28 chimeric co-receptor, most effectively enhances cytokine production, T cell persistence, and tumor control in immunodeficient murine models while preserving stem-like transcriptional features compared to native CD8β. Further rational modification of the CD28 binding motifs improves tumor control in vivo with increased intratumoral accumulation and reduced exhaustion. This benefit also extends to PRAME and WT1-specific TCRs in vitro supporting generalizability. TCR-engineered T cells have shown limited efficacy in part due to the absence of co-stimulation leading to limited accumulation in solid tumors. The authors here show engineering the CD8β coreceptor with an intracellular CD28 domain enhances cytokine production, persistence, and tumor control in vivo independent of tumor-associated co-stimulatory ligand encounter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>WRN structural flexibility showcased through fragment-based lead discovery of inhibitors</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66768-8</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-66768-8</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 02:15:12 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Rachel L.
