This implies that the STLFZ was not significantly thickened at the time of melting. Furthermore, the STLFZ LMAs were emplaced at ca. 130−115 Ma, later than the Dabie LMAs (ca. 143−130 Ma). These spatial, temporal, and genetic differences probably reflect the reactivation of the Tan-Lu Fault (ca. 146−130 Ma), which triggered dehydration melting, crustal foundering, and mantle metasomatism in the Dabie Orogen. Subsequent underplating of hydrous magmas beneath the STLFZ then facilitated fluid-fluxed melting under normal crustal thickness conditions. These findings provide new insights into the heterogeneous mechanisms of adakitic magmatism and the role of major tectonic structures in controlling crustal evolution.

In this study, we performed piston-cylinder experiments to constrain the β-factor for Ag isotopic fractionation by diffusion in anhydrous granitic melts. By regression and error estimation of the diffusive isotope profiles, we obtained β-values of 0.317 ± 0.036 and 0.274 ± 0.016 for the two diffusion experiments.

Measurements of particle attenuation through the water column have historically been used to infer the sequestration potential of the biological carbon pump. While often modelled using a simple power-law fit, this simplification may obscure important depth-dependent processes. Using data from biogeochemical-Argo floats in the Southern Ocean, here we show that splitting the water column into two distinct regimes captures depth-dependent variability in particle attenuation more effectively. Compared to the simple power-law fit the model reveals greater attenuation just below the productive layer, reducing particulate organic carbon flux into the mesopelagic (200 – 400 m) by 40 – 60%. Our findings suggest a more mechanistic representation of particle attenuation is needed to improve estimates of carbon transport and to reduce uncertainties in ocean-climate feedbacks and future climate projections.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract The downward transport of organic particles produced by marine organisms is a key control on the ocean’s carbon storage. Measurements of particle attenuation through the water column have historically been used to infer the sequestration potential of the biological carbon pump. While often modelled using a simple power-law fit, this simplification may obscure important depth-dependent processes. Using data from biogeochemical-Argo floats in the Southern Ocean, here we show that splitting the water column into two distinct regimes captures depth-dependent variability in particle attenuation more effectively. Compared to the simple power-law fit the model reveals greater attenuation just below the productive layer, reducing particulate organic carbon flux into the mesopelagic (200 – 400 m) by 40 – 60%. Our findings suggest a more mechanistic representation of particle attenuation is needed to improve estimates of carbon transport and to reduce uncertainties in ocean-climate feedbacks and future climate projections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Ultrahigh-pressure elasticity of dense hydrous SiO2</title><link>https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2025-9927</link><guid>10.2138/am-2025-9927</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:20:38 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Yuichiro Mori</dc:creator><dc:creator>Motohiko Murakami</dc:creator><dc:creator>Takashi Yoshino</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hiroyuki Kagi</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>American Mineralogist</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.2138/am-2025-9927</prism:doi><description>Abstract Dense SiO2 phases such as stishovite and CaCl2-type SiO2 are the most elastically stiff minerals among major silicate and oxide minerals in the Earth’s mantle. Those phases have a significantly high water solubility compared to other nominally anhydrous minerals in the lower mantle. To date, there have been no direct measurements of sound velocity on dense hydrous SiO2. In this study, shear wave velocity of hydrous SiO2 was measured at room temperature up to 100 GPa using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell. Compared to anhydrous SiO2, the shear wave velocity of hydrous SiO2 is significantly lower, but the difference of them gradually diminishes with increasing pressure. Water incorporation drastically softens SiO2 at lower pressure, whereas progressively make it stiffer with increasing pressure. These results suggest that water incorporation into SiO2 could produce the elastically distinct region with negative shear wave velocity anomalies in the lower mantle. This observation indicates that SiO2 can be a likely cause of water-induced stiffening of silicate minerals with increasing pressure.

Our results point to an Earth system state characterized by a moderate climate with sufficient O 2 for early animal respiration. These observations reflect a coevolution of life, climate, and the atmosphere, where a largely unrecognized episode of oxygenation and CO 2 drawdown was driven by the breakup of the supercontinent Nuna and the complexification of algal eukaryotes.

Geological archives of past greenhouse climates provide essential tests for models under extreme forcing. We investigate how precipitation responded to extreme warmth during early Palaeogene global warming events (66–47.8 million years ago)—a period considered a possible analogue for worst-case future scenarios. Here we compile global palaeoclimate data and develop a multi-proxy approach that integrates sedimentary proxies—such as plant fossils, ancient soils and river deposits—providing constraints on global precipitation intermittency (seasonal and interannual variability) and intensity (rainfall rate). The data reveal wet or monsoonal polar regions and aridity punctuated by intense rainfall at mid- and low-latitude continental interiors. This hydroclimate shift occurred 3 million years before and persisted 7 million years after the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum—the warmest period of the Cenozoic Era, suggesting that extreme warmth induces nonlinearities in the hydrological cycle’s sensitivity to temperature increase. Polar humidity and mid-latitude aridity further indicate a departure from the expected wet-gets-wetter and dry-gets-drier response. Shifts towards aridity were decoupled from mean annual precipitation and driven by seasonal and interannual precipitation distribution, such as shorter wet-season lengths and longer interannual rainfall recurrence intervals. This highlights the importance of considering precipitation intermittency and intensity, as similar shifts may occur under future warming despite differences in boundary conditions. Mid-latitude precipitation became less frequent but more intense through the early Palaeogene, reflecting a global hydroclimate response to extreme warming, according to a global multi-proxy reconstruction of precipitation characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;Warming is pushing Earthʼs system towards unfamiliar climate conditions, complicating predictions. Geological archives of past greenhouse climates provide essential tests for models under extreme forcing. We investigate how precipitation responded to extreme warmth during early Palaeogene global warming events (66–47.8 million years ago)—a period considered a possible analogue for worst-case future scenarios. Here we compile global palaeoclimate data and develop a multi-proxy approach that integrates sedimentary proxies—such as plant fossils, ancient soils and river deposits—providing constraints on global precipitation intermittency (seasonal and interannual variability) and intensity (rainfall rate). The data reveal wet or monsoonal polar regions and aridity punctuated by intense rainfall at mid- and low-latitude continental interiors. This hydroclimate shift occurred 3 million years before and persisted 7 million years after the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum—the warmest period of the Cenozoic Era, suggesting that extreme warmth induces nonlinearities in the hydrological cycle’s sensitivity to temperature increase. Polar humidity and mid-latitude aridity further indicate a departure from the expected wet-gets-wetter and dry-gets-drier response. Shifts towards aridity were decoupled from mean annual precipitation and driven by seasonal and interannual precipitation distribution, such as shorter wet-season lengths and longer interannual rainfall recurrence intervals. This highlights the importance of considering precipitation intermittency and intensity, as similar shifts may occur under future warming despite differences in boundary conditions. Mid-latitude precipitation became less frequent but more intense through the early Palaeogene, reflecting a global hydroclimate response to extreme warming, according to a global multi-proxy reconstruction of precipitation characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Increased Continental Exposure as a Driver of Carbon Drawdown and Initiation of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2025gl119356</link><guid>10.1029/2025gl119356</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 09:41:36 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Yinggang Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shuai Yuan</dc:creator><dc:creator>Benjamin J.

Vertical uplift rates based on terrace uplift are 1.34 ± 0.21 mm/yr for terrace T5 and 1.29 ± 0.27 mm/yr for T4, while shortening rates derived from balanced cross sections reach 1.94 ± 0.25 mm/yr and 1.87 ± 0.36 mm/yr, respectively. These values exceed those estimated from near-field fault scarp measurements, indicating that localized scarp data may underestimate true deformation. The similarity of shortening rates along different segments of the North Qilian Shan fault supports the interpretation that this fault system plays a key role in accommodating crustal shortening, uplift, and northward propagation of the Qilian Shan.

Aqueous alteration of basaltic-komatiitic crust likely supplied key nutrients, extending benthic microbial habitats into the deeper Paleoarchean ocean and supporting a thriving biosphere independent of continental exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Wave-mixing cathodoluminescence microscopy of low-frequency excitations</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67288-1</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-67288-1</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 10:37:35 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Leila Prelat</dc:creator><dc:creator>Eduardo J.
