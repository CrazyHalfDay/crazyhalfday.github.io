As a natural supercontinuum source of light, free electrons couple with phonons, plasmons, electron-hole pairs, inter- and intra-band transitions, and inner-shell ionization. The multiple excitations, intertwined with the intricate nature of nanostructured samples, present significant challenges in isolating specific spectral characteristics amidst complex experimental backgrounds. Here we introduce the approach of synthetic complex frequency waves to mitigate these challenges in free-electron–light interaction. The complex frequency waves, created through causality-informed coherent superposition of real-frequency waves induced by free electrons, offer virtual gain to offset material losses. This amplifies and enhances spectral features, as confirmed by our electron energy loss and cathodoluminescence measurements on multilayer membranes, suspended nanoparticles, and film-coupled nanostructures. Strikingly, we reveal that our approach can retrieve resonance excitation completely buried underneath the zero-loss peak, substantially enhance the quality of hyperspectral imaging, and resolve entangled multiple-photon–electron events in their quantum interaction.

&lt;p&gt;Electron-beam microscopy and spectroscopy featuring atomic-scale spatial resolution have become essential tools used daily in almost all branches of nanoscale science and technology. As a natural supercontinuum source of light, free electrons couple with phonons, plasmons, electron-hole pairs, inter- and intra-band transitions, and inner-shell ionization. The multiple excitations, intertwined with the intricate nature of nanostructured samples, present significant challenges in isolating specific spectral characteristics amidst complex experimental backgrounds. Here we introduce the approach of synthetic complex frequency waves to mitigate these challenges in free-electron–light interaction. The complex frequency waves, created through causality-informed coherent superposition of real-frequency waves induced by free electrons, offer virtual gain to offset material losses. This amplifies and enhances spectral features, as confirmed by our electron energy loss and cathodoluminescence measurements on multilayer membranes, suspended nanoparticles, and film-coupled nanostructures. Strikingly, we reveal that our approach can retrieve resonance excitation completely buried underneath the zero-loss peak, substantially enhance the quality of hyperspectral imaging, and resolve entangled multiple-photon–electron events in their quantum interaction. Our findings indicate the versatile utility of complex frequency waves in various electron-beam spectroscopy and their promising diagnostic capabilities in free-electron quantum optics. This work introduces synthetic gain to electron-beam spectroscopy, greatly enhancing spectral resolution and revealing hidden features, enabling advances in nanoscale analysis and free electron-based quantum optics under challenging signal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Increased electromagnetic interference shielding and load bearing with a three-dimensional pristine graphene@pyrocarbon skeleton in AZ91D</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-68266-3</link><guid>10.1038/s41467-025-68266-3</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 04:33:18 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Yuan Ma</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lingjun Guo</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yuchen Cao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lehua Qi</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>Nature Communications</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1038/s41467-025-68266-3</prism:doi><description>The development of electronic devices for communication systems, radar warning, and satellite detection requires lightweight materials that exhibit exceptional electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding while maintaining mechanical robustness.

Lithics are amphibole-bearing lavas with compositions forming three main clusters, namely crystal-rich andesites, andesites and rhyodacites; juveniles are biotite-bearing rhyolites including mafic enclaves, and VC15 rocks are olivine-bearing andesites. The most primitive magmas (crystal-rich andesites and a juvenile enclave) are not cogenetic, being generated by differentiation of parental magmas deriving from mantle sources variably metasomatised by slab-derived fluids or melts. Trace element and isotope data show that Santorini, Kolumbo and VC15 cone are separate volcanic systems, despite their proximity. Kolumbo mafic/intermediate magmas underwent variable degrees of deep contamination with lower crustal lithologies, in contrast to the neighbouring Santorini where magmas assimilated the upper crust. Our data indicate that the plumbing system for the pre-1650 CE activity of Kolumbo (back to ~ 200–250&amp;nbsp;ka, at least) is made up of multiple, polybaric (~ 6–18&amp;nbsp;km), small and variably evolved magma reservoirs. This structure is similar to that proposed for the mafic magma system feeding the 1650 CE rhyolites, suggesting a steady state for the deep plumbing system throughout the history of Kolumbo. The mafic inputs increased with time, arriving at shallow levels during the 1650 CE eruption, and likely continuing in the current state of Kolumbo, as indicated by geophysical data.

Lithics are amphibole-bearing lavas with compositions forming three main clusters, namely crystal-rich andesites, andesites and rhyodacites; juveniles are biotite-bearing rhyolites including mafic enclaves, and VC15 rocks are olivine-bearing andesites. The most primitive magmas (crystal-rich andesites and a juvenile enclave) are not cogenetic, being generated by differentiation of parental magmas deriving from mantle sources variably metasomatised by slab-derived fluids or melts. Trace element and isotope data show that Santorini, Kolumbo and VC15 cone are separate volcanic systems, despite their proximity. Kolumbo mafic/intermediate magmas underwent variable degrees of deep contamination with lower crustal lithologies, in contrast to the neighbouring Santorini where magmas assimilated the upper crust. Our data indicate that the plumbing system for the pre-1650 CE activity of Kolumbo (back to ~ 200–250&amp;amp;nbsp;ka, at least) is made up of multiple, polybaric (~ 6–18&amp;amp;nbsp;km), small and variably evolved magma reservoirs. This structure is similar to that proposed for the mafic magma system feeding the 1650 CE rhyolites, suggesting a steady state for the deep plumbing system throughout the history of Kolumbo. The mafic inputs increased with time, arriving at shallow levels during the 1650 CE eruption, and likely continuing in the current state of Kolumbo, as indicated by geophysical data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Numerical study on cladding burst behavior considering irradiation and oxidation with the multiphysics coupling method</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jandt.2026.01.003</link><guid>10.1016/j.jandt.2026.01.003</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:20:47 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Runhua Gao</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xin Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Shangke Li</dc:creator><dc:creator>Junjie Yu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gen Li</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>International Journal of Advanced Nuclear Reactor Design and Technology</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1016/j.jandt.2026.01.003</prism:doi><description>This study investigates alterations in the performance of fuel rod cladding during loss of coolant accident through the development of a two-dimensional axisymmetric burst analytical model using COMSOL Multiphysics.

This comprehensive approach enables multi-physics field coupling of heat-fluid-solid-irradiation-oxidation interactions. To elucidate the complex oxidation effects, the analysis separates three key components: oxidative oxygen uptake, crack depth, and degree of hydrogenation, examining their individual impacts on cladding behavior. The results indicated that under irradiation conditions with fast neutron flux of 2×10 18 ∼8×10 18 n/m 2 s, the model predicts an acceleration of burst time by approximately 8 seconds and a 41% reduction in burst strain, attributed to lattice structure deterioration from irradiation-induced defects. The oxidation analysis shows that when the oxygen uptake increases from 3% to 20%, the burst time is delayed. This clearly demonstrates the protective role of the ZrO 2 layer. Crack depth analysis shows that increasing depth from 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm substantially reduces both cladding burst strain and strength. Hydrogen content shows a phase-dependent effect: in the low-temperature α -phase, it decreases cladding plastic toughness, with 600 ppm hydrogen reducing the burst strain to about 10% at 900 K and 1000 ppm hydrogen reducing the burst strain to 5%, while enhancing performance in the high-temperature β -phase. These findings provide crucial theoretical support and reference data for nuclear reactor safety design and operation, contributing significantly to the understanding of cladding behavior under complex operating conditions.

Here, we develop a controlled self-assembly strategy for dislocations in Bi(Fe,Mn)O3 thin films on Ni-Cr that directly addresses this challenge. By employing a LaNiO3 buffer layer, we template a discontinuous-columnar grain structure and guide the self-assembly of edge dislocations along grain boundaries in a topologically-protected configuration. The resulting ordered microstructure promotes a more uniform strain field and more coherent FeO6 octahedral tilting, significantly enhances polarization homogeneity, leading to a lower domain-switching barrier and a more uniform domain pinning effect. Consequently, the BFMO thin film exhibits dramatically superior aging stability after 60 days at 60 °C, exhibiting far smaller reductions in remanent polarization (~20%) and coercive field (~35%) compared to the BFMO thin film grown directly on Ni-Cr. These findings establish a defect engineering paradigm wherein the deliberate dislocation rearrangement is leveraged to unlock superior ferroelectric performance. Controlled dislocation self-assembly is demonstrated in discontinuous-columnar Bi(Fe,Mn)O3 thin film. Guiding dislocations along grain boundaries tailors polarization homogeneity, revealing a microstructure-driven design principle for ferroelectrics.

This strategy provides an effective route for synthesizing complex layered crystals and offers versatile platforms for advancing spintronic applications. Van der Waals materials of the MB2T4 family (M = transition metal or rare-earth metal, B = Bi or Sb, T = Te, Se, or S) have attracted interest for their magnetic and topological properties, but their direct synthesis into 2D form remains challenging. Here the authors report a flux-assisted, phase-controlled growth strategy to directly grow six magnetic 2D MB2T4 crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Global subsidence of river deltas</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09928-6</link><guid>10.1038/s41586-025-09928-6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:01:27 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>L.

Here we present spatially variable surface-elevation changes across 40 global deltas using interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Using this dataset, we quantify delta surface-elevation loss and show the prevalence and severity of subsidence in river deltas worldwide. Our analysis of three key anthropogenic drivers of delta elevation changes shows that groundwater storage has the strongest relative influence on vertical land motion in 10 of the 40 deltas. The other deltas are either influenced by multiple drivers or dominated by sediment flux or urban expansion. Furthermore, we find that contemporary subsidence surpasses absolute (geocentric) sea-level rise as the dominant driver of relative sea-level rise for most deltas over the twenty-first century. These findings suggest the need for targeted interventions addressing subsidence as an immediate and localized challenge, in parallel with broader efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change-driven global sea-level rise.
