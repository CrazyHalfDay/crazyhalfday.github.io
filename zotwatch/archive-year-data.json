This study investigates Mo concentrations and isotope compositions ( δ 98/95 Mo, relative to NIST SRM3134) in basalts from DSDP Sites 417A, 417D, and 418A in the Atlantic, which experienced varying extent of seafloor alteration. These samples display significant Mo concentration (28 to 738 ng/g) and Mo isotopic variability ( δ 98/95 Mo = −2.33‰ to +0.99‰), resulting from distinct alteration conditions. Basalts from Site 417A, which generally underwent oxidative alteration at high water–rock ratios, exhibit low Mo concentrations and low δ 98/95 Mo values (−0.43 ± 0.26‰; 1σ). In these samples, the Mo mobilization ratios (R Mo = [Mo] AOC /[Mo] fresh ) show a positive correlation with δ 98/95 Mo and negative correlations with fluid–rock interaction proxies (e.g., K, Rb, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr), which is consistent with preferential leaching of isotopically heavy Mo from primary minerals during basalt dissolution. In contrast, samples from Site 417D generally exhibit Mo enrichment (ΔMo up to 3) and higher δ 98/95 Mo (up to +0.99‰), likely resulting from carbonate precipitation under relatively reducing conditions. Samples from Site 418A mostly show Mo uptake (R Mo up to 4.5) but lower δ 98/95 Mo (−0.80 ± 0.53‰; 1σ), consistent with adsorption onto Fe-oxyhydroxides in sub-oxic environments. These findings indicate the dual role of altered ocean crust as both Mo sink and source on varying localized scales, which needs consideration in discussing global Mo cycling. The heterogeneity of Mo isotopes in altered ocean crust challenges its characterization as a uniform reservoir and support the notion that deep, unaltered ocean crust may dominate slab-derived Mo fluxes in subduction zones.

We analyzed major and trace elements and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope compositions of lavas and dikes of the protoarc stage, especially boninites. We also analyzed amphibolites and metacherts of the metamorphic sole, as subducted slab materials. Furthermore, we examined trace element patterns reconstructed based on analyses of whole rocks and relict clinopyroxene phenocrysts from volcanic rocks of both axial and protoarc stages. The compositions of protoarc tholeiites, which represent the first and most voluminous magmas generated in the protoarc stage, are consistent with flux melting of residual depleted mantle, metasomatized by aqueous fluids liberated from the amphibolite‐facies slab. On the other hand, the successively produced calc‐alkaline, low‐Si boninites show distinctly radiogenic Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope ratios, spoon‐shaped rare earth patterns, and low Nb/Ta ratios, which require addition of amphibolite slab fluids formed at higher temperatures as well as small amounts of mafic‐sedimentary hybrid slab melt to the residual highly depleted mantle. Although axial lavas lack enrichment in fluid‐mobile elements except for K, later off‐ridge lavas exhibit clear K, Sr, and Pb enrichments, suggesting decompression melting of fluid‐metasomatized mantle associated with subduction initiation near the dying spreading ridge.

The introduction of magmatic volatiles in VMS systems may serve as an additional source of these elements. However, the processes through which magmatic volatiles and ore metals have been introduced into hydrothermal systems responsible for the formation of ancient VMS deposits, especially in ancient deposits, remain poorly understood. In this study, we thoroughly conducted Hg isotopic analyses of minerals (pyrite and chalcopyrite) and host rocks, combined to in-situ trace element and Fe redox states of chlorite (i.e. Fe 3+ /∑Fe determined by synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structure) from the Early to Middle Devonian, large-tonnage Ashele VMS deposit in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, in order to understand the sources of ore-forming metals and metallogenic processes. Our results show that ore-associated sulfides and igneous rocks display a wide variation of 0.35‰ in Δ 199 Hg (−0.17‰ to 0.18‰), which overlaps with those of seawater (∼0.2‰), primitive mantle (∼0‰) and continental sediments (∼-0.25‰), supporting a ternary mixing of Hg from three distinct sources. Most of the ore-associated sulfides show near-zero Δ 199 Hg values of −0.1 to 0.1‰, suggesting that ore metals were primarily derived from magmatic fluids, rather than from leaching of underlying volcanic host rocks by heated seawater. The THg (total Hg) content in sulfides and chlorite decreases with increasing distance from the mineralization center, reflecting the variable influence of magmatic volatiles released from the underlying magmatic system, while fluid boiling likely leads to significant variations in δ 202 Hg (exceeding 2‰). The elevated Fe 3+ /∑Fe values, distinct Hg and Sn enrichments, and high formation temperatures (above 400 °C) recorded by Hg-rich chlorite suggest that acidic, hot, oxidized, metal-rich volatiles facilitate the transport of Cu and S from the magmatic to the hydrothermal environment, promoting the formation of large VMS deposits. We propose that the Early Devonian extensional setting enabled oxidized magmatism and volatiles, facilitating efficient Cu and S transport, during which the metal-rich magmatic-hydrothermal fluids (Δ 199 Hg ≈ 0) mixed with seawater (Δ 199 Hg > 0) and continental sediments (Δ 199 Hg 199 Hg range.

Copper isotope values in the lower 1,000 m of the mineralized potassic and phyllic altered porphyry zone increase slightly upwards in the range of +0.2 to +0.4‰, and scatter in the upper phyllic and advanced argillic zone (δ 65 Cu: ‒3.7‰ to +2.7‰). The near-surface low-Cu leached zone has very negative δ 65 Cu values down to ‒6.5‰ and there are also some distinctly negative excursions in the deep potassic zone with subordinate advanced argillic alteration. Molybdenum isotope values are slightly negative in the potassic porphyry zone (δ 98 Mo: ‒0.3 to ‒0.2‰), but increase over the phyllic zone to positive values of 0.2‒0.3‰, and strongly scatter at the transition to the high-sulfidation epithermal system. The Cu and Mo isotope patterns can be mainly attributed to Rayleigh fractionation between vapor and brine in the magmatic-hydrothermal porphyry system and to redox-controlled isotope shifts during supergene alteration in the epithermal system.

This study investigates the redox state of the high-Ti picritic magma in the Emeishan Large Igneous Province (ELIP) by estimating ƒO₂ via the olivine-melt vanadium partition and platinum-group element (PGE) abundances. Olivine compositions and trace element systematics indicate that the primary magmas of high-Ti picrites could be produced through ~5% partial melting from peridotite mantle source at 3.1-5.1 GPa. Olivine-melt V oxybarometry reveals that the primary magmas exhibit relatively high 𝑓𝑂₂ (ΔFMQ +1.2 to +1.5). The high PGE concentrations (16.0-27.5 ng/g) of the picrites imply that the mantle sulfides were readily dissolved during low-degree partial melting, suggesting that they might have originated from relatively oxidized mantle sources. The elevated 𝑓𝑂₂, inherent from the mantle source, might have promoted early crystallization of Fe–Ti oxides, which ultimately drives the formation of giant Fe–Ti–V oxide deposits. The PGE depletion in the high-Ti basaltic magmas suggests that sulfide saturation was reached during magma evolution, implying the potential for sulfide-poor PGE mineralization at depth. However, due to the relatively high sulfur contents at sulfide-liquid saturation (SCSS) of these oxidized high-Ti magmas, large-scale Cu–Ni sulfide deposits could form only where sulfur-rich, reducing sedimentary strata were assimilated.

Here, we report the first definitive example of polymetamorphism in metapelites of the Baoyintu Group, central Inner Mongolia. Our analyses included petrographic observations, phase equilibrium modelling, as well as U–Pb and Rb–Sr geochronology. Garnet–white mica schist exhibits two stages of garnet growth: an early‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (I) with epidote + phengite + quartz + rutile (I) inclusions and a late‐stage assemblage of chlorite + garnet (II) + muscovite + quartz + ilmenite + staurolite + rutile (II) in the matrix. Phase equilibrium modelling yields pressures of 16–22 kbar and temperatures of 400°C–500°C for the early‐stage assemblage corresponding to blueschist facies metamorphism, and 6–7 kbar and ~550°C for the late‐stage assemblage corresponding to amphibolite facies metamorphism. A garnet–two mica schist contains a mineral assemblage similar to the late‐stage assemblage in garnet–white mica schist, yielding peak pressures of 4–5 kbar and temperatures of 570°C–580°C. Zircon and rutile U–Pb geochronology of the metapelite samples yielded two groups of metamorphic ages (c. 384 and c. 259–236 Ma). In situ mica Rb–Sr geochronology of the garnet‐two mica schist yielded an age of 215 Ma interpreted to record cooling after the Permian–Triassic metamorphic peak temperature. These results reveal that medium‐ and low‐dP/dT metamorphism occurred during the late Permian–early Triassic that overprinted Devonian high‐dP/dT metamorphism. Based on previous studies of magmatism in the region, we relate the two stages of metamorphism to subduction of Paleo‐Asian oceanic lithosphere (Devonian, c. 384 Ma) and back‐arc extension (Permian–Triassic, 259–236 Ma).

To reconstruct primary Na contents of kimberlitic melts, we quantified Na partitioning between olivine and volatile-rich kimberlitic melts (Note: abstract contains math symbols that cannot be translated here; see PDF). Applying this calibration to magmatic olivine from 22 kimberlites yields reconstructed Na2Omelt of 1.9−8.6 wt% (typically ±0.25 wt%) at 1 GPa, showing that magmatic Na contents are much higher than indicated by bulk rock measurements. The lower range of these reconstructed Na2O values aligns with the predicted 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% of asthenospheric carbonated silicate melts generated from typical lherzolitic mantle at 7 GPa. The higher values correspond to the same 3.5 ± 0.5 wt% if recalculated for olivine crystallization at 2−4 GPa. Because Na2O loss through fluid exsolution during kimberlite ascent cannot exceed 0.5 wt%, the extreme Na loss leading to the observed low bulk-kimberlite values must occur upon solidification when copious amounts of Na-rich fluids are expelled.

In this paper, we use numerical models of continental rifting to investigate whether proximity to cratonic lithosphere enhances the ore-forming potential during rift basin evolution. Our results show that narrow asymmetric and wide rifts respond differently to the presence of close cratonic edges. The potential for metallogenesis in narrow asymmetric rifts decreases with increasing proximity to the craton edge. In contrast, metal source rock area and ore-forming mechanisms increase when wide rifts form close to a craton edge. We attribute these responses to the increased lithospheric strength on the craton-ward side of the rift that determines not only the initial fault geometry, but also the subsequent fault development and migration direction. This modifies the spatial and temporal overlap of the components of the mineral system required for deposit formation, i.e., source rock, fluid-focussing faults, and deposit host rock. The greatest metallogenic potential is found in the narrow margin of narrow asymmetric rifts formed far from a craton edge; here, the largest area of source rock is concentrated in the main border basin. The link between craton edges and metallogenic potential, therefore, is hypothesized to be due to the preferred initialization of rifts next to, and the preferential preservation of deposits on, the edges of stable cratons.", "authors": ["Anne C.

Some minerals, such as apatite and calcite, which crystallize across diverse lithologies during magmatic differentiation, can record geochemical changes in their crystallizing environments, thereby providing valuable insights into the genesis of these rock suites. The Wajilitage Carbonatite Complex (WCC) in northwest China, part of the Tarim Large Igneous Province, is a typical carbonatite–alkaline complex composed of calcite and dolomite carbonatites, aillikite, nephelinite, and nepheline syenite. In this study, in situ geochemical and C–O isotope analyses of apatite and calcite are utilized to investigate their genetic relationships. The Mg content of apatite (Mgap) serves as an effective recorder of the magmatic evolution of this carbonatite–alkaline complex. Apatite in the carbonatite has higher Mg contents than apatite in the nephelinite and nepheline syenite, precluding an origin via fractional crystallization or liquid immiscibility from these silicate melts. Although the Mg contents of apatite in the carbonatites overlap with those of apatite phenocrysts in aillikite, their distinct trace-element compositions (e.g. La, Sr, and Y) and δ18OV-SMOW values rule out a direct genetic relationship between these rocks. We propose that the carbonatites formed independently by low-degree partial melting of a carbonated mantle source. Subsequent fractional crystallization of calcite and dolomite from this parental magma produced the calcite and dolomite carbonatites, respectively. Trace elements and δ18OV-SMOW values of apatite suggest that nephelinite evolved to nepheline syenite, the latter of which assimilated the aillikite. Differentiation of the carbonatite magma generated distinct styles of rare earth element (REE) mineralization, with light REE (LREE) being enriched in dolomite carbonatite, and both LREE and heavy REE (HREE) being enriched in calcite carbonatite. This study presents an integrated petrogentic model for the WCC, highlighting the utility of apatite geochemistry in unraveling the complex magmatic evolution of carbonatite–alkaline complexes.", "authors": ["Zhiguo Cheng", "Zhaochong Zhang", "Ziliang Jin", "Matthew J Brzozowski"], "doi": "10.1093/petrology/egag011", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egag011", "published": "2026-02-03T12:35:57+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Petrology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-10"}, "score": 0.5840871246653981, "similarity": 0.6132919269694255, "impact_factor_score": 0.4672679154492888, "impact_factor": 3.5, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "consider", "translated_title": "瓦吉里塔格碳酸岩杂岩体中碳酸岩与硅酸盐岩石的岩石成因联系：来自磷灰石和方解石原位地球化学和同位素分析的启示", "domain": "岩石学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在解决火成岩岩石学中关于碳酸岩与伴生硅酸盐岩石之间成因联系的长期争议。", "methodology": "研究采用了对瓦吉里塔格碳酸岩杂岩体中的磷灰石和方解石进行原位地球化学和C-O同位素分析。", "key_findings": "碳酸岩独立形成于碳酸盐化地幔源的低度部分熔融，而霞石岩演化为霞石正长岩并同化了艾利辉石，且碳酸岩岩浆分异产生不同的稀土元素富集模式。", "innovation": "本研究提出了瓦吉里塔格碳酸岩杂岩体的综合成因模型，并强调了磷灰石地球化学在揭示复杂岩浆演化中的有效性。", "relevance_note": "这项研究为碳酸岩-碱性杂岩体的成因提供了宝贵见解，有助于相关领域研究者理解复杂的岩浆演化过程。"}}, {"source": "crossref", "identifier": "10.1016/j.gca.2026.01.052", "title": "A tungsten-182 and trace element perspective on the origin of the FOcal ZOne (FOZO) component", "abstract": "Small variations in 182 W/ 184 W resulting from the decay of 182 Hf to 182 W while 182 Hf was extant during the first ∼60 Myr of Solar System history are present in some modern ocean island basalts (OIB). The lowest ratios, or most negative μ 182 W values when calculated as parts per million variations from an assumed Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) value, correspond with elevated 3 He/ 4 He compositions for some OIB lavas. Possible explanations for these anomalous isotopic compositions include: 1) core-mantle interaction following initial core-mantle separation or 2) early differentiation of the silicate mantle. Elevated 3 He/ 4 He in OIB originates from a less-degassed portion of the mantle, compared to the accessible upper mantle, and has been associated with a moderately depleted mantle component with long-lived radiogenic isotope characteristics intermediate to all known extreme mantle endmembers. This component has commonly been referred to as the “FOcal ZOne” or FOZO. In addition to these characteristics, FOZO has been suggested to have anomalous enrichments in the high field strength elements (HFSE) Ti, Ta, and Nb. Tungsten is a moderately siderophile element that behaves as an HFSE in the silicate Earth, and in some OIB, μ 182 W and Ti, Ta, and Nb enrichments display negative correlations. To further investigate the relation between anomalous μ 182 W, 3 He/ 4 He and Ti, Ta, and Nb enrichments in melts most closely associated with the FOZO mantle source, we analyzed basalts from three intraplate volcanic tracks, Easter-Salas y Gomez, Bowie-Kodiak, and Louisville, for μ 182 W and bulk major and trace elements. The new isotopic data for each hotspot system record μ 182 W values that are within the global range of OIB (Easter-Salas y Gomez μ 182 W = +3 to −17; Bowie-Kodiak μ 182 W = +1 to −12; and Louisville μ 182 W = −1 to −9). To test whether these compositions can be explained by the crystallization of an early basal magma ocean and subsequent long-term isolation of its crystallization products, a simple fractional crystallization model was developed. We find that nearly all isotopic and trace element compositions inferred for the FOZO component can be reproduced by the chemical fractionations produced with this model. Furthermore, the model is consistent with data for additional OIB sampled globally. Finally, our model results also indicate that the Sm/Nd ratio in the inferred FOZO reservoir may not be sufficiently modified by bridgmanite fractionation to generate resolvable μ 142 Nd anomalies in OIB (resulting from decay in the 146 Sm- 142 Nd short-lived system) relative to BSE. This is consistent with the lack of μ 142 Nd anomalies in most OIB, even where negative μ 182 W anomalies are largest. Collectively, these findings indicate that at least some of the anomalous 182 W/ 184 W compositions observed in modern OIB may plausibly originate from a differentiation product of the silicate mantle that formed within the first 60 Ma of Solar System history, and without the need for core-mantle interaction.", "authors": ["V.A.

In these mush-dominated systems, it is likely that melt-mush reactions between migrating melts and the pre-existing mush influence the chemical evolution of magmas. However, melt-mush reactions and their effect on the chemical evolution of arc magmas can be elusive and cannot be constrained when studying erupted lavas in isolation. In this study, we focus on the island of St. Vincent in the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc because (1) the composition of erupted lavas has been interpreted to reflect simple fractional crystallisation, with minimal influence of other magmatic processes, and (2) an abundance of plutonic xenoliths (erupted fragments of crystal mush) can be found within the eruptive products. Thus, we are able to compare interpretations gleaned from the chemistry of erupted lavas with new observations of the crystal mush in the same magmatic system. To this end, textural analyses were undertaken on seventeen representative plutonic xenoliths from St Vincent, and four of these samples (two olivine gabbros, two hornblende-olivine gabbros) were studied in detail via element mapping, mineral trace element analyses and geochemical modelling. The chemical, textural and mineralogical characteristics of the olivine gabbros were best explained via fractional crystallisation in the mid-upper crust (~6–18 km depth). However, the hornblende-olivine gabbros (two of seventeen samples studied) contained clear textural evidence for melt-mush reaction in the mid-upper crust. The trace element compositions of minerals such as clinopyroxene in these two samples were best reproduced via assimilation-fractional crystallisation modelling, simulating melt-mush reactions, supporting the textural evidence. Our plutonic xenoliths reveal that in addition to fractional crystallisation, cryptic (i.e. not directly recorded in lavas) melt-mush reaction processes also contribute to magma chemical evolution, particularly influencing trace elements, within the sub-volcanic plumbing system. Textural evidence for melt-mush reaction is increasingly reported in plutonic xenoliths from other active arcs and exhumed arc crustal sections, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous in mush-dominated arc plumbing systems. Melt-mush reaction therefore represents an important process contributing to arc magma and arc crust trace element chemical diversity.", "authors": ["Joshua R Brown", "George F Cooper", "Madeleine C S Humphreys", "Alexander A Iveson", "Christopher J Ottley", "Julie Prytulak"], "doi": "10.1093/petrology/egag014", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egag014", "published": "2026-02-06T12:42:35+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Petrology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-10"}, "score": 0.5746017077416911, "similarity": 0.6014351558147916, "impact_factor_score": 0.4672679154492888, "impact_factor": 3.5, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "consider", "translated_title": "深成岩捕虏体揭示了小安的列斯群岛弧圣文森特岛下方岩浆管道系统中隐蔽的熔体-泥浆反应过程的影响", "domain": "岩石学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "How do cryptic melt-mush reactions influence the chemical evolution of arc magmas, especially when not directly recorded in erupted lavas?", "methodology": "The study conducted textural analyses, element mapping, mineral trace element analyses, and assimilation-fractional crystallisation modeling on plutonic xenoliths from St Vincent.", "key_findings": "Plutonic xenoliths reveal cryptic melt-mush reactions, alongside fractional crystallization, contribute significantly to magma chemical evolution, particularly influencing trace elements in the sub-volcanic plumbing system.", "innovation": "The study uniquely uses plutonic xenoliths to directly identify and model cryptic melt-mush reactions, a process previously elusive when studying only erupted lavas.", "relevance_note": "This research demonstrates that ubiquitous melt-mush reactions are crucial for understanding arc magma and crustal trace element diversity, impacting subduction zone petrology."}}, {"source": "crossref", "identifier": "10.1130/g53827.1", "title": "Growth and physical transport of molybdenite spherules in a Na-Al-F-rich melt, Cave Peak porphyry Mo deposit, Texas, USA", "abstract": "The Eocene Cave Peak intrusive complex in Trans-Pecos Texas, USA, hosts a porphyry Mo system enriched in Mo, F, Nb, W, Sn, and rare earth elements.

The mineral/melt partitioning behaviors of vanadium (V) and europium (Eu) are sensitive to f O 2 , and thus capable of evaluating the f O 2 of rocks.

The expansion of Antarctic glaciers eroded the underlying bedrock and increased the weathering flux to the ocean. However, the role silicate and carbonate weathering play in atmospheric CO 2 removal and the CCD through Ca 2+ and alkalinity production is poorly understood. Magnesium isotopes (δ 26 Mg) are fractionated during carbonate and clay mineral formation and can be used to quantify the relative flux from silicate and carbonate weathering. Here, we report the δ 26 Mg composition of the carbonate, reactive (ferromanganese coatings), and residual (silicate) fraction of marine sediments from the Kerguelen Plateau (Ocean Drilling Program Site 738), near a major drainage system of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, to explore the response of subglacial and shelf weathering to ice sheet expansion. The δ 26 Mg of the carbonate fraction (−2.29‰ to −0.95‰), reactive fraction (−0.36‰ to 0.10‰), and residual fraction (−0.05‰ to 0.55‰) display similar values to surface‐dwelling calcareous nannofossils, deep‐water ferromanganese nodules, and Antarctic bedrock, respectively.

Here, we report Sn isotopic compositions of cassiterite and Zn isotopic compositions of paragenetically later, lower-temperature sphalerite from ten Sn and Zn-bearing polymetallic deposits in the Bolivian tin belt. These deposits represent distinct mineralization styles and metal transport pathways. The δ 124 Sn values for cassiterite vary from −0.56 to 1.64‰ (n = 33) and δ 66 Zn values for sphalerite vary from −0.22 to 0.92‰ (n = 20), encompassing much of the global variance observed for each isotopic system. The Llallagua and Huanuni deposits show significantly heavier Sn isotope compositions (average = 1.24 ± 0.24‰ δ 124 Sn; n = 10) compared to all other deposits (average = 0.56 ± 0.55‰; n = 23) and contain several distinguishing geological attributes including: genetic association with porphyry phase stocks and/or dikes, vapor-rich and moderately to highly saline fluid inclusions, vertically restricted and/or discontinuous high-grade veins, and extensive tourmaline-rich magmatic-hydrothermal breccias. Together, these features are consistent with Rayleigh fractionation and suggest that orthomagmatic fluid separation, fluid boiling, and oxidation contributed to cassiterite precipitation and caused Sn isotope fractionation. The residual fluids after cassiterite precipitation were depleted in heavy Sn isotopes and propagated along district-scale fluid pathways. The Sn isotopic ranges for cassiterite from the Sayaquira (−0.13–1.45‰), Colquiri (0.18–1.44‰), Colcha (0.07–1.47‰), and Monserrat (−0.56–0.93‰) deposits may be a consequence of cassiterite precipitation over longer mineralization length scales with increased meteoric water influx, where distal cassiterite precipitated from hydrothermal ore fluid that was depleted in heavy 124 Sn. The wide and heavy range of Zn isotopic compositions of sphalerite suggests that early orthomagmatic fluid separation and boiling may have caused significant isotopic fractionation during early fluid transport prior to sphalerite precipitation. Subsequent processes including dilution by Sn- and Zn-poor meteoric water and the concomitant change in fluid pH and increase in oxygen fugacity plausibly contributed to the precipitation of isotopically lighter sphalerite at the Monserrat, El Salvador, and Huari Huari deposits", "authors": ["Evan C.

In practise, insights have proved difficult to obtain because of the limited spatiotemporal resolution of palaeomagnetic records and uncertainties in how to interpret them. Here we use palaeomagnetic datasets and models alongside numerical simulations of the geodynamo to show that certain observed characteristics of ancient magnetic field behaviour are uniquely or preferentially reproduced in the presence of strong lateral variability in core–mantle heat flux. Our findings suggest that strong contrasts in the spatial pattern of the temperature gradients and/or thermal conductivity of the lowermost mantle that are linked, today, to seismologically observed structures, have influenced the geodynamo for at least the last few hundred million years.

In the northern Semail Ophiolite of the United Arab Emirates, serpentinites of the Jabal Mundassah–Malaqet (JMM) are studied using mineral chemistry, whole-rock geochemitry, and platinum-group element (PGEs) compositions to constrain protolith characteristics, melting history, and tectono-magmatic evolution. The rocks comprise massive and foliated serpentinites dominated by intergrown lizardite and antigorite with relict Cr-spinel and altered olivine. The JMM serpentinites are characterized by high MgO (34.9–39.2 wt.%), extremely low Al 2 O 3 (0.21–0.92 wt.%) and TiO 2 (0.01–0.03 wt.%), elevated Ni (up to 2462 ppm) and Cr (up to 3143 ppm), and very low high-field-strength element (HFSE) and Th–U contents. These features indicate a highly refractory dunite–harzburgite protolith formed by extensive melt extraction. This interpretation is reinforced by Cr-spinel compositions (Cr# = 0.42–0.48; Mg# = 0.58–0.61) and low total PGE abundances (ΣPGE ≈ 15–35 ppb), which are diagnostic of a strongly depleted, sulfide-exhausted mantle residue. Pronounced depletion in HFSE coupled with diagnostic Nb–Th systematics definitively fingerprints a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) fore-arc tectonic setting. PGE systematics (ΣPGE ≈ 8–26 ppb; modest Pt–Pd enrichment over Os–Ir–Ru; low Pd/Ir=1.18-1.61) record moderate partial melting followed by selective mobilization of PPGEs during serpentinization, preserving a dominantly magmatic signature with a limited metasomatic overprint. We propose the JMM serpentinites originated as a highly depleted mantle residue during intra-oceanic subduction initiation. It was subsequently serpentinized by slab-derived fluids under fore-arc conditions before being tectonically emplaced onto the Arabian margin during Late Cretaceous ophiolite obduction.

However, the subduction histories remain controversial. We employed detrital zircon U‐Pb geochronology and trace element analyses to investigate the provenance of strata of this age within the Jiamusi Massif of NE China. To mitigate age bias from variations in zircon fertility, we compiled zirconium concentrations from 338 granitoid samples across the massif, grouped into four categories: Neoproterozoic (996–722 Ma), early Paleozoic (538–446 Ma), late Paleozoic‐early Mesozoic (338–209 Ma), and Cretaceous (112–92 Ma). Applying the zircon fertility factors (ZFFs) revealed no difference between the early Paleozoic and late Paleozoic‐early Mesozoic suites, which we combined, resulting in values of 1.58, 1.45, and 1.0, respectively. After correcting detrital zircon age spectra using these ZFFs, a sediment provenance shift was evident from active magmatic arcs along the eastern margin of the Jiamusi Massif during the early Permian, to collisional orogenesis between the Jiamusi and Songliao massifs in the Late Triassic along the western margin. Integration with regional tectonic data defines a transition in geodynamics from subduction of the Mongol‐Okhotsk Ocean in the early Permian to combined subduction and collision related to the Paleo‐Pacific domain in the Late Triassic.

The Awati-Manjar transition zone in the northern Tarim Basin contains extensive mafic intrusions, predominantly composed of diabases, making it a critical region for strengthening our understanding of the evolution and dynamics of the Tarim LIP. In this paper, we conducted an integrated analysis of the newly identified diabase intrusions in the Awati-Manjar transition zone of the northern Tarim Basin, including seismic and drilling data interpretation, petrographic observations, U-Pb isotopic dating, and whole-rock elemental and Sr-Nd isotopic analyses. Seismic and drilling data reveal two distinct occurrence models for the diabase intrusions: sill-shaped and saucer-shaped. Apatite U-Pb dating indicates that the diabases range in age from ca. 308 Ma to 266 Ma, with two distinguishable emplacement episodes identified within analytical uncertainty of 308−299 Ma and 286−266 Ma. The diabases from the earlier episode are sparsely distributed across the study area, whereas those from the later episode are widespread and constitute the majority of the diabase intrusions in the region. Geochemically, the diabases belong to an alkaline, sodium-rich, and high-Ti series. They exhibit consistent chondrite-normalized rare earth element and primitive mantle−normalized trace element patterns, marked by pronounced enrichment in light rare earth elements and highly incompatible elements, respectively. Notably, no Eu anomaly is observed, while distinct positive anomalies are present at Ba and Pb. Whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic analyses reveal relatively depleted signatures, with (87Sr/86Sr)i ratios ranging from 0.7049 to 0.7074 and εNd(t) values from +0.60 to +2.75. Both elemental and isotopic data indicate that the diabases are compositionally analogous to oceanic-island basalt, implying a genetic link to a mantle plume. That is, they were likely formed through partial melting of a mantle plume source, followed by variable degrees of crustal assimilation and fractional crystallization. More significantly, our newly acquired geological data reveal that the mafic intrusions within the Tarim LIP actually exhibit a longer emplacement duration (spanning the entire lifespan of the Tarim LIP) and a broader spatial distribution (extending beyond the craton margins into its interior) than previously considered.

However, the processes occurring from melt formation to evolution following crustal anatexis, as well as their contributions to magma compositions, remain unclear. This study characterizes the chemical composition and B isotope systematics of tourmaline and muscovite, along with whole-rock geochemistry in high-silica granitic rocks from the central Himalaya. We use these data to constrain the melt formation and subsequent fluid-magma interactions in high-silica granites. The leucosomes exhibit high CaO, Sr, Sr/Y, and Eu/Eu* values but low Rb and Rb/Sr contents, characteristic of hydration melting. Muscovite in the leucosomes shows a significant B isotope range (δ 11 B = −20.6‰ to −5.8‰), with δ 11 B values displaying negative correlations with B, Rb, and Cs contents, and positive correlations with Rb/Cs ratios. These patterns reflect increasing muscovite breakdown during prograde hydration melting. The leucogranites were classified into two groups, including tourmaline and two-mica leucogranites. Compared to the two-mica leucogranites, the tourmaline leucogranites are characterized by higher Rb, Rb/Sr, but lower CaO, Sr/Y, Eu/Eu*, and muscovite δ 11 B values. These geochemical differences primarily reflect distinct melting reactions: tourmaline leucogranites result from muscovite dehydration melting, whereas two-mica leucogranites form through hydration melting. In tourmaline leucogranites, tourmaline exhibits δ 11 B ranging from −18.2‰ to −13.5‰, with increasing δ 11 B values and Nb, Ta, and rare earth element (REE) contents from core to rim, indicative of fluid-magma interactions. Magmatic fluid metasomatism also explains the muscovite B isotopic zoning from both leucogranite types, with rims showing elevated δ 11 B, Rb, Cs, and B values alongside notably decreased Nb/Ta ratios. Geochemical modeling suggests that fluid–magma interaction with fluid/magma ratios of 0.2–0.6 could produce the observed B isotopic zoning. Therefore, in-situ tourmaline and muscovite B systematic studies reveal the role of magmatic fluids in the generation of the Himalayan leucogranites. Furthermore, the leucogranites exhibit higher whole-rock and muscovite rare-metal (Li, Nb, Ta, Rb, and Cs) contents than the leucosomes. The rare metals increased, accompanied by the sharply decreased Nb/Ta ratios in the muscovite rims. This evidence supports that the magmatic fluid metasomatism represents a key mechanism for elevating rare metal contents in high-silica granites.", "authors": ["Shuaiqi Liu", "Guibin Zhang", "Qi Jin", "Lu Xiong", "Shuzhen Wang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemgeo.2026.123284", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2026.123284", "published": "2026-02-02T16:26:36+00:00", "venue": "Chemical Geology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-08"}, "score": 0.5556118652979494, "similarity": 0.5759908199391391, "impact_factor_score": 0.4740960467331898, "impact_factor": 3.6, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "consider", "translated_title": "电气石和白云母的硼同位素记录了高硅花岗岩中的熔体形成和流体-岩浆相互作用", "domain": "岩石学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在阐明高硅花岗岩熔体形成和演化过程及其对岩浆组成的贡献，特别是地壳深熔后的机制。", "methodology": "研究人员分析了喜马拉雅高硅花岗岩中电气石和白云母的化学成分、B同位素体系以及全岩地球化学。", "key_findings": "研究发现两种白岗岩类型分别由脱水熔融和水合熔融形成，且岩浆流体交代作用是稀有金属富集的关键机制。", "innovation": "本文首次利用电气石和白云母原位B同位素体系，结合地球化学模型，揭示了喜马拉雅白岗岩中岩浆流体作用。", "relevance_note": "这项研究为理解高硅花岗岩的成因、岩浆演化以及稀有金属矿化提供了关键见解和新证据。"}}, {"source": "crossref", "identifier": "10.1007/s00410-025-02285-7", "title": "Age and geochemistry of carbonatites and associated silicate rocks in Sarnu-Dandali alkaline complex, Deccan Large Igneous Province: Evidence for melt immiscibility and plume-lithosphere interaction", "abstract": "Carbonate–silicate liquid immiscibility is the most widely accepted petrogenetic model for explaining the origin of carbonatites, accounting for approximately three-quarters of global carbonatite occurrences. Many, however, attribute the coexistence of carbonatites and alkaline silicate rocks to the coincidental emplacement of two independent parental magmas through a single crustal conduit. Thus, the exact cause of the carbonatite-alkaline silicate rock association remains equivocal. Here, we present the results of 40Ar/39Ar dating, geochemical, and C-O-Sr–Nd-Pb isotopic investigations of the Sarnu-Dandali carbonatite-alkaline complex, part of the Deccan Large Igneous Province (LIP), to shed light on this coexistence. Additionally, we explore the roles of the Deccan-Reunion mantle plume and the Indian continental lithosphere in generating the carbonatites of the complex. 40Ar/39Ar age data reveal that, although the complex underwent multiple cycles of alkaline magmatism, the activity at ~ 68.8 Ma was synchronous with the carbonatite intrusion. Interlaced spatial association of carbonatites and alkaline silicate rocks, including melt inclusions of the former in the latter, their complementary trace element patterns (and δ13C and δ18O), and overlapping initial Sr–Nd-Pb isotopic ratios indicate their co-genesis through carbonate–silicate liquid immiscibility. Trace element and isotopic ratio modeling suggests that the parental melanephelinitic magma for the complex evolved through concurrent crustal assimilation (up to 6%), fractional crystallization of silicates, and immiscible separation of carbonate melt, with the latter occurring before phonolite crystallization.

We report the first measurements of δ 7 Li for eleven of the main rivers in Guadeloupe and four thermal springs on the slopes of La Soufrière volcano. We have measured a large range of δ 7 Li values (3.0–31.6‰) that we explained by different water–rock interaction processes at the scale of this small island. First, the rivers affected by hydrothermal inputs are the most concentrated and isotopically lighter (δ 7 Li from 3.0–12.3‰). This is partly attributed to the leaching and dissolution of clay-rich, hydrothermally-altered rocks which are presumed to have low δ 7 Li value and to the discharge from the hot-springs on La Soufrière volcano. The rivers not impacted by hydrothermal inputs are more diluted and isotopically heavier (δ 7 Li from 16.0–31.6‰), highlighting two distinct weathering processes in the regolith: the precipitation and dissolution of secondary minerals. In the youngest part of the island, the rivers are characterized by high δ 7 Li values, emphasizing that dissolved lithium is mainly controlled by the dissolution of primary andesitic minerals and the incorporation of 6 Li into secondary minerals. While in the oldest part of the island, the rivers are characterized by lower δ 7 Li values, which are partly attributed to a low δ 7 Li source from the dissolution of secondary minerals in the regolith. We also show a positive correlation between δ 7 Li in river waters and the chemical weathering rates (CWR), related to the weatherable primary minerals content in watersheds.

To address this issue, we present an integrated Fe isotope dataset for whole-rocks and key minerals (e.g., biotite and ilmenite) from a continuous granitic gneiss-migmatite-pegmatite sequence in the North Qaidam ultrahigh-pressure belt. Petrology, whole-rock major, trace element and Nd isotope indicate that the migmatite and pegmatite originated from fluid-absent muscovite-present melting in the granitic gneiss, possibly via the following reaction: Ms. + Pl + Qtz → Kfs + Sill + Bt + Melt.

After evaluating the effects of weathering/alteration, diffusion, and fluid exsolution, multi-mineral interactions are inferred to be the primary driver of Fe fractionation during crustal anatexis: (1) The retention of ilmenite (δ 56 Fe = −0.16 ± 0.01‰) in the residue resulted in significant Fe isotope fractionation between melanosomes and leucosomes. (2) Peritectic biotite in diatexites exhibits higher δ 56 Fe values (0.18 ± 0.03‰) than residual biotite (0.10 ± 0.02‰) and its entrainment elevated the 56 Fe values in the diatexites during melt migration. (3) Pegmatites display the highest δ 56 Fe (0.22–0.26‰), largely reflecting feldspar accumulation.

The numerical experiments show that delaminated segments force hot asthenospheric mantle upwards, causing characteristic magmatic expression in the overriding continental lithosphere. Dehydration of the mantle transition zone (MTZ) would rehydrate a layer of the asthenospheric mantle and form a channel for deep mantle upwelling. The material produced by the interaction between the partial melting of the delaminated segments and deep mantle peridotite would be brought up with the hot mantle upwelling, generating igneous rocks in the intracontinental crust. The crustal magmatism from delamination is expressed in two stages: (a) a rapid phase of high‐volume magmatism related to the detachment of lower lithosphere and replacement with asthenosphere; and (b) a slower and extended phase of magmatism associated with partial melting of the foundered lithosphere in the MTZ. The model provides a novel explanation for the regional intracontinental magmatism that is characterized by a short‐term volcanic climax and a subsequent longer‐term weakened magmatism in the Songliao Basin since the late Mesozoic.", "authors": ["Xincheng Li", "Lin Chen", "Yuguang Hou", "Russell N.

The density contrast between silicate melts and the surrounding solid residue exerts a primary control on many magmatic processes. However, direct measurements of the density of silicate melts at high pressure ( P ) and temperature ( T ) conditions remain challenging, particularly for the highly viscous and reactive silica‐ and alkali‐rich melts. Here we determined the high P ‐ T densities of three sodium aluminosilicate melts with nepheline (NaAlSiO 4 ), jadeite (NaAlSi 2 O 6 ), and albite (NaAlSi 3 O 8 ) compositions, using the high‐ P X‐ray microtomography technique up to 4.1 GPa and 2020 K. Our results suggest that the substitution of (NaAl) 4+ for Si 4+ along the NaAlSiO 4 ‐NaAlSi 3 O 8 join leads to higher melt density and lower melt compressibility. In addition, our new data, combined with a wide range of literature data, were employed to re‐calibrate a modified hard‐sphere equation of state (HS‐EOS) for silicate melts, which provides a unified framework for calculating the density and other compressional properties of multi‐component silicate melts in the CaO‐MgO‐Al 2 O 3 ‐SiO 2 ‐FeO‐Na 2 O‐K 2 O (CMASFNK) system up to ∼25 GPa. The calibration also reveals that SiO 2 , alkalis, and CaO are the major components contributing to the compositional dependence of melt elastic properties.

The remainder are ocean-island-like with little evidence for ocean-ridge settings. Hadean JH zircons probably originated from distinct terranes with separate tectonic histories. Subduction-related magmatism in the Hadean, as documented by JH zircons, alternated with periods of magmatic quiescence.

Molybdenum (Mo) isotopes provide new constraints due to their fractionation between the upper continental crust and the mantle. However, data on Mo isotope compositions from the lower continental crust, an important intermediary layer, remain scarce, hindering the effective utilization of Mo isotopes in understanding continental crust formation and evolution. This study investigates the Mo isotope compositions of mafic granulite and websterite xenoliths derived from Mesozoic basalts in the western Cathaysia Block to directly constrain the mechanisms underlying Mo isotope variations in the juvenile lower continental crust. Xenoliths with high Mo concentrations show mantle-like δ 98/95 Mo (−0.18 ‰), whereas those with low Mo concentrations display significant variation in δ 98/95 Mo values (−1.94 ‰ to 0.55 ‰). This significant variation cannot be fully explained by mantle heterogeneity, as supported by Sr Nd isotopes with limited variability and low Nb/Zr, (La/Sm) N , and Th/Yb ratios. The lack of covariance between δ 98/95 Mo and differentiation index Mg# argues against magmatic differentiation governing Mo isotopic fractionation. Most samples show a sharp decline in δ 98/95 Mo values with decreasing Mo/Ce ratios, far below mantle values, suggesting that fluid leaching is responsible for the observed Mo isotope fractionation. Based on newly obtained Mo isotope data for these Mesozoic xenoliths, the juvenile lower crust beneath the Cathaysia Block is enriched in extremely light Mo isotopes compared to the mantle. It is proposed that widely distributed fluids in the crust may be an important reservoir for balancing Earth's Mo isotope system.

Although it is well-established that subducting slabs supply the primary energy driving most earthquakes, the quantitative relationship between slab dynamics and seismic events remains poorly understood. Here we develop a comprehensive 3D geodynamic model of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system to quantitatively connect long-term slab dynamics with earthquake activity. Based on an analytical thermal model combined with slab geometry, we find that earthquakes predominantly occur under conditions cooler than ∼ 900 ∘ C, defining a thermal boundary for the seismogenic zone. Within this zone, we identify a notable spatial correlation between the modeled energy dissipation rate and the observed distribution of seismicity, indicating that seismicity is intrinsically driven by long-term tectonic deformation. Furthermore, our comparison of the modeled stress state predictions with observed earthquake focal mechanisms reveals that both shallow megathrust and outer-rise earthquakes, as well as deep earthquakes associated with plate bending at the mantle transition zone, can be explained by slab dynamics. By analyzing the misfit between modeled and observed focal mechanisms, we further constrain slab rheology, finding that shallow earthquakes favor a relatively weak slab (yield stress of 100 – 150MPa), while deep earthquakes prefer a stronger slab (300 - 500MPa) accompanied by a 10 – 100–fold viscosity increase at the 660 km phase transition.

The Liuan lode gold deposit in the Dayaoshan district (South China) features multiple generations of pyrite, including Py1 (pre-ore stage), Py2 (including Py2c and Py2r) and Py3 (ore stage), and Py4 (post-ore stage). Py2c is As-Cu-Pb-Ag-Au-rich (initial gold enrichment), suggestive of fluid boiling during its formation, corroborated by low δ 34 S values (avg. −3.83‰) and hydrothermal breccias. In contrast, Py2r is depleted in these elements, indicative of non-boiling conditions, further supported by heavier δ 34 S values (avg. −2.53‰). Several pieces of evidence, including sharp reaction fronts and As-Au contents differences between Py2c and Py3, and Py2c remnants and mineral inclusions (chalcopyrite, galena, and native gold) within Py3, indicate the CDR process, during which Au in Py2c was remobilized and reprecipitated as native gold. The CDR process is triggered by oxidation of the mineralizing fluids, consistent with the decreasing δ 34 S values from Py2r to Py3. Combined with higher Co-Ni concentrations in Py3 (similar to Py2c) relative to Py2r, we infer that fluid oxidation is associated with hydraulic fracturing restart.

More importantly, the diorites display high Ba-Sr (Ba + Sr = 898 – 1720 ppm) signatures and characterized by amphibole-rich lithologies. These geochemical and isotopic signatures suggest that the parental magmas of the diorites were most likely generated by partial melting of the mantle wedge metasomatized by the subducted oceanic slab during the early stage, and subsequently the high Ba-Sr melts differentiate to generate the Datian diorite in a continental arc setting.

The development of its theoretical framework began with the observation of mantle heterogeneity revealed by the radiogenic isotopic compositions of ocean island basalts (OIBs) and mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), which in turn gave rise to the classic “crustal recycling” model. Based on this, a suite of globally representative mantle end-member components, namely DMM (Depleted MORB Mantle), EMI (Enriched Mantle I), EMII (Enriched Mantle II), HIMU (High μ, μ=238U/204Pb) and PREMA (prevalent mantle), was identified, thereby establishing a comprehensive framework to characterize the geochemical structure and geodynamic system of the mantle. Over the past five decades, mantle geochemistry has advanced with new analytical techniques and theoretical development, greatly broadening its scope. It is now a key field within the Earth System Sciences, crucial for developing models of deep material cycling and surface environmental responses.

However, it is unclear how carbonated silicate melts are formed. Here, we report whole-rock major and trace element, and Mg-Zn-Fe isotope, and in situ olivine and clinopyroxene Mg isotope data for peridotites and pyroxenites in Cenozoic alkaline basalts from Shulan and Yitong, Northeast China, to reveal the formation mechanisms of carbonated silicate melts. As residues of the primitive mantle, most of the Shulan and Yitong (spinel) harzburgite and lherzolite have relatively lower δ26Mg and higher δ66Zn than the mantle values, and show LREE-enriched patterns. These features indicate that these peridotites have been modified by carbonated silicate melt, transforming them into carbonated peridotites. The Shulan websterites exhibit metasomatic textures, and most of their whole-rock and in situ δ26Mg values are lower than the mantle values, which also supports the presence of a carbonated lithospheric mantle. The Yitong cumulate orthopyroxenites, representing silica-rich melts, have lower δ26Mg and higher δ66Zn values than mantle peridotites, implying that recycled carbonate has been involved in these silica-rich melts. The Yitong cumulate wehrlites and (olivine) websterites display major element compositions similar to those of carbonated peridotite melts, coupled with low whole-rock and clinopyroxene δ26Mg values, high δ66Zn and δ57Fe values, indicating the occurrence of carbonated silicate melts. The transition from orthopyroxenites to (olivine) websterites is marked by the decreasing of their whole-rock δ26Mg, δ57Fe values and Zn/Fe ratios and increasing of their δ66Zn values, along with decreasing of their crystallization temperatures, suggesting that silica-rich melts were gradually transformed into carbonated silicate melts via continuous interaction with carbonated peridotite.

Here, we performed a comprehensive investigation of petrography, phase equilibria modelling, and zircon U-Pb dating for felsic and Mg-Fe-Al granulites from the Kunlun-Qaidam Massif in north Qingzang Plateau. Three episodes of metamorphism were inferred, involving two episodes of low pressure (LP)-UHTM intervened by an episode of medium-pressure and high-temperature (MP-HT) metamorphism.

The process can create normal-fault-bounded core complexes hundreds of kilometers wide, in which metamorphic continental crust derived from the subducting plate is exposed. Horizontal tectonic stress and the thickness of the downgoing upper crust control the width of complexes, their topographic elevation, and the subduction depth of exposed rocks.

With more than 0.7 million tonnes (Mt) of Zn reserves at average grades ranging from 4–8%, the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field comprises representative deposits such as those of Caiyuanhe, Heli, and Qingshuitang. The ore bodies, which exhibit stratiform, vein-like, and lenticular forms, are hosted within the Cambrian Qingxudong Formation dolomite and are spatially associated with the NE-trending Mandong fault. This Zn ore field in Southwest China is a classic example of Zn-rich mineralization. However, the genetic mechanisms and processes responsible for the Zn-rich nature of these MVT Pb‒Zn deposits remain poorly understood. This study aims to characterize Zn mineralization in the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field, Southwest China. The rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol2) from the syn-ore stage vary between 5.63 and 32.50 ppm (with an average of 14.07 ppm), whereas in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol3) from post-ore stage, the values range from 45.63 to 95.69 ppm (with an average of 72.03 ppm). The fluid inclusions of Dol2 and Dol3 exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 98–204°C (with an average of 143°C) and 98–195°C (with an average of 132°C), with corresponding salinity ranges of 13.0–29.5 wt% (with an average of 20.9 wt%) and 16.0–25.7 wt% (with an average of 18.9 wt%) NaCl equivalent, respectively.

In this study, an Fe- and Zn-enriched NaCl-H₂O basement brine is identified as the ore-forming fluid responsible for the Zn-rich MVT deposits. During its low- to medium-temperature migration, the fluid was channelled by the Mandong fault and Wangsi anticline structural framework, which provided ideal pathways and traps. During migration, the fluid leached sulfur (reduced from evaporites to H 2 S) from wall rocks and ultimately precipitated within dolomite faults and fractures. The distinct Zn-rich character of the deposits stems from the following two key factors: a primary derivation from the Zn-rich basement of the Yangtze Block and a chemical preference for Zn enrichment, which is driven by the differing fractionation coefficients of Zn- and Pb-chloride complexes in the NaCl–H 2 O system.

Mineralogical modeling reveals that iron enrichment via solid iron-rich magnesiowüstite [(Mg,Fe)O] matches this seismic constraint, independent of modeled ULVZ thickness. Enrichment of metallic iron-rich magnesiowüstite likely enhances the thermal conductivity of mega-ULVZs and provides a mechanism to drive localized plume upwelling.

Here, we present whole-rock geochemical and Ba–Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic data for basalts from the sediment-rich Luzon Arc and the sediment-poor Bicol Arc to constrain the recycling processes of fluid mobile elements (FME) in different subduction settings. Our results suggest that the mantle wedge beneath the Luzon and Bicol arcs was primarily metasomatized by melts from subducted sediments and fluids from subducted oceanic crust, respectively. The basalts from both arcs show variable δ 138/134 Ba values despite their limited variations in Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopes, reflecting the heterogeneous dehydration of phengite in subducted sediments and oceanic crust, which have undergone different extents of Ba isotopic fractionation at shallow depths. Luzon back-arc basalts (BAB) exhibit Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic compositions similar to those of island arc basalts (IAB), yet possess more variable and lighter Ba isotopic compositions. This defines a distinct Ba isotopic lightening trend across the arc, reflecting progressive Ba isotopic fractionation associated with enhanced phengite dehydration at increasing subduction depths. The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts. We propose that subducted oceanic crust plays a role similar to that of subducted sediments in recycling FME, such as K, Rb, and Ba, owing to the buffering effect of phengite.

The widespread occurrence of fluorine-bearing minerals (e.g., fluorite, fluorapatite, and bastnäsite) in carbonatites indicates that their parent magmas are rich in fluorine. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which fluorine controls REE and Nb mineralization remain unclear. Building on previous work, we systematically synthesize the regulatory role of fluorine in REE and Nb mineralization throughout the entire magmatic evolution of carbonatites. Our key findings are: (1) during partial melting, fluorine decreases the solidus of carbonated peridotite, thereby enhancing the generation and stability of carbonatitic melt. (2) In the mantle melting stage, it lowers the partition coefficients of REE and Nb between mantle minerals and melt, effectively promoting their extraction. (3) Throughout magmatic crystallization, fluorine significantly enriches REE and Nb in the residual melt. (4) During liquid immiscibility, fluorine exerts limited influence, as the partition behaviors of REE and Nb are primarily governed by structural differences between the conjugate melts. (5) In the hydrothermal stage, fluorine facilitates the mobilization, transport, and ultimate precipitation of REE- and Nb-bearing minerals, directly driving mineralization. The presented evidence implies that carbonatitic melts and fluoride-bearing minerals exert primary control over the spatial distribution and mineralization potential of REE and Nb.

Field, geochemical, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data support generation of the ferroan magmas at midcrustal depth by melting of calc-alkaline plutonic rocks or by protracted differentiation of a parental basalt, and production of the I-type magmas by partial melting of gabbroic rocks at greater depth. Metasomatism by fluids bearing Na, F, and high field strength elements enriched some ferroan rocks to produce peralkaline granite.

A new high resolution He isotope study of basaltic glasses from southernmost Iceland (63°N) to 55°N along the Reykjanes Ridge demonstrates a broad peak of 3 He/ 4 He (16.0 R a ) centred around 60°N that coincides with the first topographic high (VSR-1). The magnitude of the He isotope anomaly broadly scales with the excess temperature inferred from crustal thickness. This supports the hypothesis that thickened oceanic crust is a consequence of a pulse of hotter mantle within the upwelling plume that flows down the Reykjanes Ridge. The along-ridge 3 He/ 4 He peak at 59-62°N is significantly longer (320 km) than the thickened oceanic crust of VSR-1 (60-70 km). This can most simply be explained if the hot mantle blob is surrounded by a high 3 He/ 4 He mantle carapace that has a temperature similar to the surrounding mantle.

Although the absence of orogenic eclogites from Archean crust may be due to a tectonic mode dominated by plumes, paleomagnetic data from several Archean cratons indicate periods of lithospheric mobility interspersed with periods of stasis, demonstrating differential motions that require active tectonic boundaries between them. The apparent contradiction between a dominantly plume origin for cratonic crust and periods of lithospheric mobility can be reconciled if tectonic units were larger than the preserved cratonic nuclei in a tectonic mode with episodic subduction. The presence of xenolithic eclogites in the mantle roots of cratons suggests that moderate late-stage thickening was driven by convergence during a transition to global plate tectonics.

Our results demonstrate that fracture microstructure strongly influences iron oxide passivation and carbon dioxide mineralization, with important implications for predicting long-term performance of engineered carbon dioxide storage systems. Rougher surfaces in smaller apertures olivine fractures increase reactive surface area but hinder efficient carbon dioxide mineralization by promoting passivating iron oxide precipitates, according to an integrated experimental and modeling study.", "authors": ["Yun Yang", "Lawrence Opoku Boampong", "Haylea Nisbet", "Chelsea W.

It has undergone multiple episodes of accretionary orogenesis and was tectonically reactivated during the Cenozoic by the far-field compressional effects of the India-Eurasia continental collision. These processes have generated pronounced seismicity and recurrent earthquake-related hazards in this region. A high-resolution three-dimensional velocity model is essential for multi-scale velocity model construction, source-parameter inversion, simulation of strong ground motion, and seismic hazard assessment. In this study, we collected first-arrival body-wave travel-time data recorded by permanent stations in and around Xinjiang and processed both ambient-noise and regional-earthquake surface-wave records. The resulting dataset comprises ∼8.1 million body-wave travel-time picks—including absolute arrival times and event-pair differential times—and ∼5,000 surface-wave dispersion curves (5–50 s period). By joint inversion of these complementary body and surface wave datasets, we determined a high-resolution three-dimensional Vp and Vs model for the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Xinjiang (XJVM-1.0) with a lateral resolution of 50–100 km and a vertical resolution of ∼10 km. XJVM-1.0 reveals that the Tianshan orogen exhibits a relatively rigid upper crust that hosts abundant seismicity under far-field compression, whereas its middle-lower crust accommodates the majority of compressional stress through plastic deformation and/or partial melting. In contrast, the interiors of the Junggar and Tarim basins have experienced negligible internal deformation and are inferred to underthrust beneath the Tianshan orogen in response to the India-Eurasia collision.

This study combined mineralogical, whole-rock compositional, and redox-state analyses, along with thermodynamic modeling of spring waters. The major serpentinization event associated with mantle exhumation in the Middle to Late Jurassic was marked by extensive replacement of olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene by serpentine and subordinate magnetite. Alteration was more intense in olivine than in pyroxenes, resulting in higher serpentinization degrees in peridotites (~ 50 vol%), compared to pyroxenites (~ 10 vol%). Mineralogical evidence suggests temperatures of approximately 220 °C and 300 °C for this stage. Currently, serpentinization and H 2 generation are likely active at Mt. Prinzera, with fluid-rock interactions involving particularly the oxidation of a small fraction of Fe 2+ -serpentine and/or magnetite, rather than the primary mineral assemblage. Thermodynamic equilibria, based on the activities obtained from the aqueous speciation, and the isotope composition of the hyperalkaline water were used to estimate the temperature at depth, which appears to be markedly low. In addition, trapped H₂ accumulations originating from earlier serpentinization stages can also be considered. Thus, serpentinization may occur either at the base of Mt.

Samples were collected from the King Zn deposit of the Eastern Goldfields superterrane, Yilgarn craton, which was metamorphosed to the amphibolite facies. In situ chlorite-white mica chemical trends match the shifting positions of the 2,200W and 2,250W absorption features obtained by short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy. These include a shift from muscovite to Na muscovite in the felsic footwall approaching mineralization, to phengite in the hanging wall, and mostly mixed Fe-Mg chlorite compositions with shifts to Mg-rich chlorite in the Mg-metasomatized felsic footwall. Fluorine (up to 2,500 ppm) and Mn (up to 1.1 wt %) contents of chlorite increase systematically through the footwall of the deposit toward the massive sulfide but drop sharply in the hanging wall—a trend mirrored in F contents in white mica (up to 2,500 ppm) and Mn in garnet (up to 17 wt %). These variations are attributed to premetamorphic footwall metasomatism and can trace hydrothermal up-flow zones in metamorphosed VHMS systems. Thermal infrared (TIR) signatures (11,100W and 11,300DW) correlate negatively with almandine and positively with spessartine contents in garnet, while rare earth element (REE) profiles of garnet further aid in the assessment of VHMS prospectivity. Positive Eu anomalies and downward-dipping heavy rare earth element (HREE) profiles in garnet enriched in the almandine end member distinguish mineralization-related garnet from those of barren metamorphic or igneous origins. Several elements, including Sr-Ba-Rb contents in white mica, Al in chlorite, and Ca-Mn with positive Eu anomalies in garnet, also differentiate footwall from least altered hanging-wall units.

Here we integrate an earthquake catalogue, generated by machine-learning and template-matching techniques to enhance microseismicity detections, with geodetic data to show that seismic triggering of the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra Volcano, Galápagos Islands, was facilitated by a cryptic phase of fluid activity. Following 13 years of near-continuous magmatic inflation, totalling > 6.5 m, stress changes induced by a moment magnitude 5.4 intra-caldera earthquake on 26 June 2018 did not immediately trigger magma release from the pressurized magma reservoir. Instead, long-period earthquake swarms revealed post-seismic fluid activity along reservoir-bounding faults in the northwestern caldera, locally promoting edifice failure and facilitating magma intrusion that initiated 8 hours later.

The monzogranites show accumulated plagioclase crystals and high Ba, Sr, and CaO, whereas the HSGs show depleted Ba, Sr, and CaO, representing fractionated melt. The redox calculations (ΔNNO −0.3 to −0.1) and thermometry results (∼880−902 °C) using amphibole chemistry show oxidized and high-temperature conditions for monzogranites. The monzogranites’ high K2O and large-ion lithophile elements suggest the role of a sediment-derived enriched mantle source in their origin.

Therefore, samples of quartz, carbonate, and realgar were studied to determine the origin(s) and evolution of mineralizing fluids. The mineralization occurs in a post–Alpine brittle structure formed during Early Miocene extensional tectonism. After the failure of host rocks due to fault movement, boiling of a high-temperature (~290 °C) and moderately saline (~9 wt% NaCl equiv. ) hydrothermal solution occurred during pre–ore stage quartz mineralization at depth of 500–800 m.

However, the petrogenesis of hornblende-rich cumulates in the deep crust and their significant role in arc crustal evolution remains unclear. In this contribution, we focus on Late Jurassic mafic-ultramafic intrusive rocks from the Zedong terrane (central-eastern Gangdese area, South Tibet) and use detailed petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data to determine the origin of hornblende-rich cumulates with textural and chemical heterogeneities. The clinopyroxene (Cpx) hornblendite with adcumulate texture contains three distinct types of amphibole (cumulus, poikilitic, and minor interstitial). These amphiboles display homogeneous major and trace element compositions, consistent with crystallization from a liquid of constant composition. Rock fabric analysis further suggests that they formed by in-situ nucleation and overgrowth at the interface between the mush layer and the convecting parental magma within the magma reservoir. Type I hornblende (Hb) gabbros have an orthocumulate texture with the lowest whole-rock MgO and Mg# values. Intercumulus melt evolution revealed by mineral assemblage and compositional variations indicate that Type I gabbros formed through a peritectic reaction between clinopyroxene precursors and evolved interstitial melts, followed by melt migration and fluid exsolution in a semi-open system. Type II gabbros have the highest whole-rock MgO and Mg# values and are characterized by extensive disequilibrium features. Geochemical modeling indicates that their formation entails a melt-flushing process involving the upward percolation of deep-recharge melts through the crystal mush. This study provides petrological evidence for the multiple origins of hornblende-rich cumulates within a common middle-lower crustal magma reservoir. Their textural and chemical heterogeneities may reflect spatial variations in crystallization regimes across distinct reservoir domains. The Zedong hornblende-rich cumulates have more depleted whole-rock Sr–Nd isotopic compositions and zircon εHf(t) values than those cumulates from Early Jurassic and Cretaceous Gangdess arc. This indicates that their parental magma was derived from a more juvenile mantle wedge and records significant growth in the middle-lower crust. The Cpx hornblendite has lowest concentrations of SiO2 but highest Fe2O3T and (Dy/Yb)N ratios. The differentiation trends between the cumulate rocks and coeval non-cumulate rocks within the Zedong terrane indicate that the evolution of the Late Jurassic arc crust was mainly controlled by amphibole fractionation.

The Ti isotope systematics of volcanic island arc systems have been used as a model for the formation of continental crust, however, the behavior of Ti isotopes of rocks and minerals in continental arcs and plutonic differentiation sequences has not yet been closely examined. The behavior of Ti isotopes in plutonic systems may deviate from volcanic systems due to distinct mineral assemblages and differentiation histories. Consequently, island arcs may fail to capture the full spectrum of Ti isotope variability linked to the processes that generate and differentiate crust in continental arc systems. To test this hypothesis, we conducted Ti isotope measurements of five whole rocks which lie in the compositional range of 50 to 75 wt% SiO 2 and their Ti-bearing minerals (titanite, biotite, hornblende, magnetite) from the geochemically well-characterized calc-alkaline Tuolumne Intrusive Complex in eastern California, USA. The whole rock samples yield δ 49 Ti values that increase from +0.033 ± 0.030 ‰ (95 % CI) to +0.619 ± 0.025 ‰ (95 % CI). Titanite and magnetite mineral separates yield δ 49 Ti values that are up to 0.37 ‰ lower than the whole rock, while biotite and hornblende yield δ 49 Ti values that are within uncertainty of, or up to 0.25 ‰ higher than the whole rock. Inter-mineral Ti isotope fractionation reveals that titanite may fractionate Ti isotopes to an extent comparable with magnetite, whereas biotite and hornblende preferentially incorporate isotopically heavy Ti. The high f O 2 and f H 2 O conditions characteristic of continental arcs can favor titanite over Fe-Ti oxides as the primary host of Ti and the fractional crystallization of the former is interpreted to be the primary driver of Ti isotope fractionation in the Tuolumne magmas. However, the petrographic relationships between titanite and other Ti-bearing phases indicates that re-equilibration of Ti among minerals in long-lived plutonic systems can lead to complex Ti isotope fractionation mechanisms. Our data shows that Ti removal and fractionation imparted by mineral crystallization for the Tuolumne system can be described with a net fractionation factor of −0.18 ‰, which is congruous with calc-alkaline island arcs, despite the observation that Ti fractionation here is controlled by a different Ti phase.

The eastern South China Block (ESCB), affected by the flat subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate (PPP) during the Late Permian to Triassic, offers insights into the interplay between deep-Earth processes and the surface environment. However, how the flat subduction of PPP formed and regulated the lithosphere and topography remain unclear. To address these issues, ca. 243 Ma gabbroic-dioritic samples from Well NK-1, southern South China Sea, were analyzed for element, Sr-Nd isotopic, and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions. The data are integrated with ∼3461 geochemical datasets for ca. 265−200 Ma counterpart rocks from the ESCB. The studied rocks originated from a metasomatized lithospheric mantle. All data reveal that the flat subduction of the PPP transitioned from a high-angle subduction. During this transition, the ESCB lithosphere underwent sequential thinning (ca. 265−254 Ma), thickening (ca. 253−241 Ma), and thinning (ca. 240−200 Ma), driven by lithospheric extension, compression, and mechanical erosion, respectively. The high magma migration rates (&gt;42 km/m.y.) during ca. 253−235 Ma indicate a rapid trench-ward movement of the ESCB, which, together with lithospheric thickening, probably facilitated the formation of flat-slab subduction. In addition, the reconstructed paleo-elevation patterns correlate well with the variations in lithospheric thickness of the ESCB. Correspondingly, the reduced and enhanced continental weathering was controlled by elevation lowering and rising during the Late Permian and Early Triassic, respectively, and our study shows that the elevation-controlled variable weathering rates may cause decreases and increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

To explore the distribution and substitution mechanisms of trace elements in key minerals and clarify the deposit’s genesis, LA-ICP-MS was employed for in situ analysis of trace element compositions in sphalerite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite from different stages. In sphalerite, trace elements including Fe, Mn, Cd, Co, In, and Ag are mainly integrated into the mineral lattice through isomorphism. In pyrite, Co and Ni are primarily incorporated via coupled substitution, while in chalcopyrite, In, Ag, and Sn are predominantly integrated through coupled substitution. The Co/Ni ratio and As content in pyrite suggest the mineral formed in a medium- to low-temperature environment, with temperatures decreasing as mineralization advanced. The Ga/In and Zn/Cd ratios in sphalerite indicate its formation under medium- to low-temperature conditions, with higher temperatures during the main mineralization stage.

In order to improve the fit of model dynamic topography compared to observations, in this study, we include chemical density anomalies in Earth's lithosphere to model geoid and dynamic topography. We also combine these anomalies with lateral viscosity variations and study the effect on predicted dynamic topography and geoid and investigate which density models would yield a good fit. In the sublithospheric mantle, under the assumption that the density anomalies are induced from temperature variations, we use temperature‐dependent viscosity.

Erosion of monazite-bearing slates and phyllites, and short-range transport resulted in localised recent alluvial deposits rich in millimetre-size monazite, of which the Matamulas site, within the Central Iberian Zone, represents one of the most extensive and potentially exploitable placer-type accumulations of Th-poor grey monazite in western Europe. Nodular monazite from the Matamulas area depicts spheroidal or triaxial ellipsoid shapes and is mostly greyish, although it may display different surface colours from yellow to black. The nodules contain abundant silicate (quartz, feldspar, white mica, chlorite, zircon) and Fe oxides-hydroxides, organic matter, rutile and Mn oxide inclusions, generally oriented at random or showing orientations related to original bedding anisotropy. Nodular monazite displays concentric optical zoning, continuous or oscillatory, associated with the abundance and nature of inclusions. Chemical zoning is typically progressive, with cores enriched in medium and heavy rare earth elements (REE), and rims rich in light REE (La-Ce). Substitution of Pr by La-Ce is decoupled from that of elements with smaller ionic radii. Thorium contents are low (estimated mean 0.16 wt % ThO2) and irregularly distributed across the monazite nodules. The increased concentration of phyllosilicate and other inclusions toward nodule rims, the sparse occurrence of twinning and the observed chemical zoning suggest progressive recrystallisation and refining from precursor gels or cryptocrystalline aggregates, facilitated by localized fluid-assisted element mobility during nodule growth. U-Pb dating of monazite yields an Early Devonian age of ca. 400&nbsp;Ma, significantly older than the Upper Carboniferous age of regional metamorphism and tectonic foliation in the host metasediments. The age obtained, together with their non-oriented growth within specific levels of the sedimentary pile, indicates that the process of formation of nodular monazite took place through diagenesis or burial metamorphism.

The Kermanshah–Walash Ophiolitic Complex (KWOC) in Kurdistan, NW Iran, preserves a unique record of both mechanisms in spatially parallel but temporally distinct Late Cretaceous (Razab) and Eocene (Sarv-Abad) ophiolites. These ophiolites comprise peridotite, gabbroic bodies, a dike complex, and pillowed and massive basaltic lavas. Whole-rock geochemistry, U–Pb zircon geochronology, and field structures reveal distinct ages and tectonic settings for the two ophiolites. While radiolarian cherts constrain the Razab ophiolite to the Cretaceous, new U–Pb zircon (42–38 Ma) geochronology firmly places the formation of the Sarv-Abad oceanic core complex in the Eocene. The Cretaceous Razab unit contains high-Cr# spinel chromitite (0.77–0.82), forearc, and island arc tholeiitic (IAT) lavas, supporting formation during subduction initiation. In contrast, the Eocene Sarv-Abad unit features mylonitized gabbros, syn-extensional dikes, and contemporaneous D-MORB/E-MORB magmatism derived from heterogeneous mantle melting, diagnostic of an Oceanic Core Complex (OCC) in an extensional back-arc.

Here, through pH manipulation experiments across diverse ecosystems and with a model ammonia-oxidizing archaea species, Nitrosopumilus maritimus strain SCM1, we discover a unifying adaptive mechanism: acidification triggers a compensatory increase in substrate affinity in ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. This enhancement counteracts the reduction in ammonia availability, with the magnitude of increase being significantly greater in ammonia-oxidizing archaea than in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Consequently, in ammonia-oxidizing archaea-dominated systems, this adaptation can sustain or even stimulate oxidation rates under moderate acidification, while ammonia-oxidizing bacteria-dominated systems experience a decline. By incorporating this affinity response into models, we accurately reconcile prior disparate field observations. We thus establish the regulation of substrate affinity as a key determinant of microbial resilience, providing a framework for predicting nitrogen cycle dynamics under future acidification.

In thermally immature crust, early eruptions are expected to be mafic, yet many volcanic provinces, particularly those with water-rich melts, lack significant initial mafic volcanism, suggesting an alternative trapping mechanism. We investigate this using Caraci volcano (Romania's Apuseni Mountains), a water-rich system that started with relatively differentiated, andesitic eruptions. The first eruptions at Caraci extruded water-rich (5–6 ± 0.35 wt% dissolved H 2 O) amphibole-plagioclase andesites (890–920 ± 22 °C) stored at water-saturated conditions in the upper-crust (~2 ± 0.5 kbar). These magmas were associated with superhydrous primitive melts (>6 wt% H₂O), which evolved in a polybaric system (crystallization pressure varying from 2 to 8 ± 0.5 kbar), evidenced by high-Mg amphibole and delayed plagioclase crystallization. These deeper storage melts likely reached water saturation during ascent towards the upper crust, inducing degassing and crystallization, which increased viscosity and enabled stalling in the cold crust, explaining the lack of initial mafic eruptions and providing the efficient trapping mechanism in a thermally immature crust. Progressive drying of the source and generation of less hydrous magmas initiated the eruptions and construction of the stratovolcano, and ultimately terminated the system. As a result, the final eruption extruded somewhat drier (4–4.5 ± 0.35 wt% H 2 O), hotter (930–960 ± 45 °C) pyroxene-bearing andesites erupted from water-undersaturated storage.

The results show that the abundance and relative distribution of the naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene, and dibenzothiophene series vary significantly with increasing maturity. Based on the variation patterns of δ13C values, the aromatic hydrocarbons can be divided into two categories.

This hierarchical interlayer architecture ensures uniform Li + distribution and redistributes internal stresses, mitigating localized stress concentrations and lattice expansion to preserve structural integrity throughout cycling. The optimized LMO establishes a dual benchmark for both capacity and cycling stability in hybrid capacitive deionization, achieving a remarkable lithium extraction capacity of 4.78 mmol g −1 with 96% retention over 100 cycles, outperforming both its unoptimized counterpart and other reported materials of the same type.

Adsorptive separation via porous solids is considered one of the most promising alternatives to conventional energy-intensive cryogenic processes. While traditional adsorbents selectively capture xenon over krypton under ambient conditions, their desorption energy penalties for producing pure xenon impede practical implementation. Here, we present a metal‒organic framework characterized by synergistic structural and local flexibility that reverses conventional selectivity, thereby enabling preferential adsorption of krypton at room temperature. This material demonstrates a krypton uptake of 36.8 cm3 cm-3 (298 K, 1 bar) and achieves a Kr/Xe selectivity of 10.4 in 1/99 Kr/Xe mixture breakthrough experiments. Moreover, this material exhibits commendable radioactive stability and effectively captures trace amounts of krypton (40 ppm). Mechanistic studies indicate that dynamic adjustments in cavity windows and localized ligand vibrations work synergistically to exploit subtle size differences between krypton and xenon. This enables kinetically controlled sieving of krypton through transiently expanded channels. With an energy-efficient approach to krypton-centric separation, our research redefines the design paradigm for noble gas purification and offer new possibilities for separating other dynamically matched molecules through adaptive host‒guest interactions. Efficient Kr/Xe separation is crucial for high-tech industries, defense, and aerospace applications.

Its most recent caldera-forming eruption occurred ~1400 years ago, with numerous intra-caldera eruptions since. Erupted whole rock compositions are commonly attributed to fractional crystallisation along a single liquid line of descent, but mafic mineral clots indicate mafic recharge and magma mixing also influence whole rock compositions. Geophysical studies identified two low-velocity zones at ~0.5–4 km and 9–15 km beneath the caldera, suggesting a shallow reservoir for evolved magmas and a deeper mafic storage zone. However, uncertainties remain regarding depths, connectivity and temporal evolution of Rabaul’s magma storage zones. We present petrological and thermobarometric analyses of products from the 1937, 1994 and 2014 eruptions at Rabaul. Samples contain two distinct mineral clot types. Mafic mineral clots comprise olivine, high-anorthite plagioclase and high-Mg# clinopyroxene that are out of equilibrium with surrounding matrix glass. Textures include rapid growth rims, olivine replacement by orthopyroxene and reversely zoned clinopyroxene. We interpret these mafic mineral clots as cumulate fragments mobilised from a deep mafic mush by mafic recharge. Intermediate mineral clots contain low-anorthite plagioclase, low-Mg# clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and Ti-magnetite, and occur as macrocrysts in equilibrium with matrix glasses (Mg# 30–40). We interpret these intermediate mineral clots as fragments from a shallower, more evolved mush stored. Binary mixing models demonstrate that eruption products can be reproduced by mixing a mafic magma similar to 1937 basaltic enclaves with a dacitic magma resembling the last caldera-forming deposit. Clinopyroxene-only and clinopyroxene–liquid thermobarometry yield crystallisation pressures of 0.5–5 kbar (~2–20 km) and temperatures of 960–1125 °C, but the models lack the vertical resolution to resolve storage zones separated by ~5 km.

Here, we show that this highly prevalent stone type comprises a form of organic–inorganic polycrystalline biocomposite with integrated bacterial biofilms. Evidence from electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy reveal the unanticipated internal structure of kidney stones from human patients, where bacterial biofilms are intercalated between polycrystalline mineral layers, even in stones identified as “noninfectious” clinically, including those in patients without underlying urinary tract infections. We observe similar bacterial biofilm architectures on the surfaces of stone fragments obtained due to lithotripsy, suggesting that bacteria are intrinsic to the process of nephrolithiasis. Crystallites proximal to biofilm layers exhibit significantly smaller grain sizes, which indicate a larger local concentration of nucleation sites. Staining reveals that biofilm areas of these stones are enriched with bacterial DNA. That bacteria are now observed so broadly in kidney stones (including even in less prevalent struvite stones) may be conceptually salient: Based on the evidence adduced here, we propose a model in which the urine-rich environment of the kidney can impinge on bacterial calcium homeostasis and amplify bacterial production of nucleation templates such as extracellular DNA.

The 2025 Sagaing earthquake generated an exceptionally long rupture (∼535 km), offering a rare opportunity to investigate rupture dynamics along continental transform fault. We integrate complementary high‐resolution imaging geodesy, teleseismic and strong‐motion waveforms, back‐projection, and finite‐fault inversion to investigate rupture extent, process, and slip evolution. Our results reveal a marked bilateral asymmetry in both rupture extent and speed: it propagated ∼85 km northward at sub‐shear speeds and ∼450 km southward predominantly at supershear speeds (∼6 km/s), punctuated by short sub‐shear segments. We propose that structural barrier and stress shadows limited the extent, whereas the SF's bimaterial interface and local stress‐drop heterogeneity jointly may potentially drive the asymmetric, intermittent supershear behavior.

The core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature is modelled as decreasing over time in scenarios consistent with continuous outer-core dynamo action and inner-core crystallization. The internal heating rate is modelled as declining with radiogenic isotopes decay. By systematically varying convective vigour and core heat capacity, we demonstrate that secular cooling exerts a first-order control on deep mantle evolution.

The emergence of woven lattices—three-dimensional networks of entangled fibers—has introduced a pathway to the largely overlooked compliant and stretchable regime of metamaterials. However, the design and implementation of these complex architectures has remained a primarily manual process, restricting identification and validation of their full achievable design and property space. Here, we present a geometric design framework that encodes woven topology using a graph structure, enabling the creation of woven lattices with tunable architectures, functional gradients, and arbitrary heterogeneity. Through use of microscale in situ tension experiments and computational mechanics models, we reveal highly tunable anisotropic stiffness (varying by over an order of magnitude) and extreme stretchability (up to a stretch of four) within the design space produced by the framework. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of woven metamaterials to exhibit programmable failure patterns by leveraging tunability in the design process. This framework provides a design and modeling toolbox to access this previously unattainable high-compliance regime of mechanical metamaterials, enabling programmable large-deformation, nonlinear responses.

Here, we identified a strikingly conspicuous polarization signal used specifically during courtship in the cuttlefish Doratosepion andreanum and investigated the underlying optical mechanism. The signal consists of a pattern of adjacent horizontally and vertically polarized areas, optimizing signal detectability for cephalopod polarization vision. This pattern is generated by reflective cells called iridophores and transparent muscle: light becomes horizontally polarized when reflected by iridophores, and its angle of polarization is then rotated to vertical when transmitted through a birefringent muscle layer.

Here, inspired by natural metabolite sensing/signaling system, we develop a DNA origami-based ATP-sensing nanodevice (ND) for fine-tuning purinergic signaling and immune homeostasis. This ND composes a tubular DNA origami equipped with ATP sensors and the catalytic subunits (ENPP1-CD73 pairs), which can sense high levels of exATP and then expose the catalytic subunits for metabolizing exATP to adenosine, thereby driving an immune switch from exATP-mediated proinflammatory signals to adenosine-mediated immunosuppressive signals. Further surface displaying of ND on the monocytes (ND@Monos) enables its active inflamed site-targeting to restore immunometabolic hemostasis and reduce inflammation in diverse models in vivo. This study highlights that design of metabolite-sensing NDs is a promising strategy for controlling the homeostasis of cell metabolism and the immune response.

This study systematically evaluates EPMA parameters to establish general conditions for “single current” in situ determination of major elements, F and Cl in hornblende. Results show optimal F counting stability on TAP/LDE1 crystals at 0–5 μm beam sizes. Long dwell times with high currents reduce DLs to 11 μg g ‐1 (F) and 2 μg g ‐1 (Cl), with BG ± 10 mm yielding lower DLs than ±5 mm. However, currents beyond 100 nA cause loss of major components (notably SiO 2 ), so moderate currents are safer. For hornblende F determination, accuracy prioritises PHA setting > BG correction > probe current > counting time > reference material selection > beam size, whereas Cl is less parameter‐sensitive. A general parameter set for simultaneous in situ major element, F and Cl determination in hornblende is established, with results consistent with literature values for the Kakanui and Arenal hornblende reference materials.

Despite the wealth of sedimentological and geochemical data from these units, including precise geochronological age constraints for the younger glacial interval, there are few robust palaeomagnetic constraints on their depositional latitude between 740 and 550 Ma. Herein we summarise natural remanent magnetisation (NRM) data, acquired through progressive thermal demagnetisation, from Damara Supergroup strata in the Kunene Zone of Kaoko orogenic foreland of northwestern Namibia, including Tonian red beds of the Nabis Formation, Cryogenian interglacial carbonates and quartzites of the Etoto and Ombaatjie formations, and early Ediacaran cap carbonates of the Keilberg Member. High-stability NRM components are carried by magnetite and hematite. A pre-folding north-down component (“A1”) recorded in the Nabis Formation may record either diagenetic or Kaoko synorogenic magnetisation, while a similar post-folding north-down direction in carbonate units (“A2”) was acquired during late Kaoko orogenesis, likely through chemical processes. This component is observed elsewhere in northern Namibia as well as in other West Gondwanaland cratons, pointing to widespread remagnetisation in the early Palaeozoic. Authigenic mineral growth responsible for this NRM component may have been the result of orogenic fluids related to regional sediment-hosted base-metal mineralisation (Central African Copper Belt Type Cu-Co-Ag and Mississippi Valley Type Pb-Zn-Cu mineralisation) or clay transformation during burial diagenesis. Additional moderate to high unblocking temperature components directed south-down (“B”) or north-up (“C”) most likely record late Palaeozoic to Mesozoic chemical remagnetisation during weathering, and a low-stability north-up component (“D”) records modern weathering-related chemical remanence. These data expand the collection of known remagnetisation directions in northern Namibia, important for understanding the extent and nature of tectonic and remagnetisation events, and necessary for ascertaining the fidelity of primary palaeomagnetic poles.", "authors": ["Alexie E.G.

However, single-point-based point cloud classification faces the challenge of poor robustness, and single-scale point clusters only consider a single neighborhood, leading to insufficient feature representation. In addition, numerous cluster-based classification methods require further development in constructing point clusters and extracting their features for representing point cloud objects. To address these issues, we present a point cloud classification algorithm based on multi-level aggregated features. In our method, we employ a multi-level point cluster construction approach based on MLPCS (Multi-level Point Cluster Segmentation), which divides the original point cloud into three different levels of point clusters by voxel downsampling and rescanning, Voxel-Meanshift, and Voxel-DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). The features for each level of point clusters are extracted and their representation is improved by adopting methods like max pooling, Bag of Words (BoW) and K-Means. The multi-level point cluster features are then aggregated and combined with a random forest classifier to achieve automatic classification of point clouds. Finally, we conducted ablation and comparison experiments to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the algorithm. Our method achieved classification accuracy/Kappa coefficient of 99.88 %/99.86 % and 93.44 %/83.61 % respectively in the experiments on two sets of large-scale outdoor scene data, and the ablation

precision of their reference values are fundamental prerequisites for ensuring the accuracy of non-traditional stable isotope analysis. Nevertheless, the field currently suffers from a significant methodological gap in robust homogeneity assessment and reference value estimation protocols. To address this gap, we implemented an analytical framework that integrates data acquisition from the Geological and Environmental Reference Materials database (GeoReM) with rigorous quality control measures based on ISO (International Organization for Standardization) guidelines and the IAG Certification Protocol. This approach enabled us to systematically report the isotopic compositions of 14 non-traditional stable isotope systems along with 63 isotopic compositions. The statistical results show that most of reference materials are homogeneous. However, our investigation revealed notable difference in the δ7LiLSVEC values of AGV-1 and AGV-2, indicating potential limitations in their reliability as Li isotope reference materials. Furthermore, the Mg isotopic composition of NIST SRM 980 exhibited substantial heterogeneity, corroborating previous research findings and raising concerns about its suitability for high-precision isotopic measurements. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive set of reference values for widely used materials and establishing a rigorous, standardized protocol for their estimation.

Holsnøy is composed of dry, metastable lower crustal granulite that was infiltrated by fluids along shear zones and seismic fractures during subduction. The infiltration facilitated the localized growth of eclogite facies mineral assemblages along the fluid flow pathways. The duration of the eclogite facies metamorphism, however, remains uncertain. Previous garnet diffusion chronometry studies have estimated timescales ranging from hundreds of years to millions of years based on diffusional relaxation between metastable granulite facies garnet cores and eclogite facies garnet rims and fractures. The shorter timescales are inferred from extremely sharp Ca gradients across chemical contacts present in some garnets whereas the longer timescales are from wider Mg and Fe profiles present in all garnets. The different timescale estimates have led to divergent models for the region’s tectonometamorphic evolution. Here we show that the sharp Ca contacts can be explained by diffusion-induced compositional stress. As Ca is significantly larger than Mg and Fe, its movement strains the crystal lattice and generates stress that limits the relaxation of sharp chemical contacts. When compositional stress is accounted for, the sharp contacts yield timescales that are consistent with the wider Mg and Fe diffusion profiles. We determine that eclogite facies conditions (670–700 °C, 1.5–2.2 GPa) lasted a maximum of c. 300 kyr. The relatively short duration of eclogite facies conditions requires that multiple transient heating events were superimposed on a longer (&amp;gt;106 yr) overall timescale of metamorphism. Granulite facies garnet cores are surrounded by multiple generations of eclogite facies rims formed by interface-coupled dissolution–reprecipitation (ICDR) reactions. The garnet rims indicate two rapid, regional-scale fluid pulses and additional smaller, more localized pulses. The fluid pulses may be linked to episodes of seismic moment release as well as transient heating via exothermic hydration reactions and/or shear deformation. Our model results predict up to 400 MPa of differential stress at the garnet core–rim contacts, consistent with observed eclogite facies microfractures that extend into relic granulite facies garnet cores. The microfractures indicate that ICDR was aided by compositional stress: diffusion ahead of the reaction front generated stress and fracturing that created porosity for further ICDR. Thus, compositional stress can markedly impact both diffusion systematics and intracrystalline deformation. Together, these results show that despite their brevity, transient thermal, fluid flux, and/or baric episodes may exert the primary controls on the mineralogical and rheological development of subducted lithologies, in contrast to the long, slow burial and exhumation typically envisioned for regional metamorphism.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hess", "Jay J.

Here we present new data for Jurassic–Cretaceous andesitic and granitic rocks from the Jiang Co area of the north-central Tibetan Plateau. Jurassic magmatic rocks have zircon U-Pb ages of ca. 160 Ma and variable εHf(t) values of −10.2 to +0.5. They show geochemical affinities with high-Mg diorites and I-type granites. High-Mg diorites typically formed from melts of sediments that interacted with the overlying mantle wedge. Concurrently, I-type granites commonly originated from the mixing of magmas derived from the crust (Amdo–Dongka Co terrane) and mantle. These rocks suggest that the southern branch of the Bangong–Nujiang Meso-Tethyan Ocean probably experienced initial intraoceanic subduction in the Middle–Late Jurassic. Cretaceous granitic rocks have zircon U-Pb ages of ca. 110 Ma and negative to positive εHf (t) values of −6.4 to +5.2. Compared with Jurassic magmatic rocks, these rocks are more compositionally diverse, involving calc-alkalic metaluminous–peraluminous ferroan (A2-type) and highly fractionated I-type granites that were generally derived from magma mixing between ancient crust and depleted mantle. These rocks usually formed in a collisional setting, which indicates that the Bangong–Nujiang Meso-Tethyan Ocean had closed by this time. Finally, we propose that the Bangong–Nujiang Meso-Tethyan Ocean experienced four-stages of tectonic evolution during the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous: initial intraoceanic subduction (170–155 Ma), flat subduction (155–140 Ma), slab rollback (140–130 Ma), and continental collision (120–110 Ma) during the Mesozoic.

The composition, deformation features, and ages of major rock units in accretionary complexes, preserved in the mélanges of the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone, provide important insights into the nature, polarity, and timing of subduction events. Investigations of the accretionary complexes in the eastern segment of the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone, along with coeval extrusive rocks, reveal two magmatic arc systems at 196 Ma and 163−153 Ma. The sedimentary units represent an Early Jurassic island arc and a Middle Jurassic−Early Cretaceous forearc trench-basin deposited in response to the northward subduction of the Meso-Tethys Ocean. The detritus in the Early Jurassic island-arc deposits preserves the records of the 196 Ma intraoceanic arc alongside contributions from oceanic crust during the early development of the basin. Geochemical data indicate that the basalts were derived from an enriched mantle source with negligible continental crust contamination. In contrast, detritus within the Middle Jurassic−Early Cretaceous arc-accretionary system reveals a mixed source, including contributions from continental marginal arcs dated to 163−153 Ma, oceanic crust, and northern terranes. Furthermore, the 163−160 Ma high-Mg andesites originated from the melting of sediments derived from a subducted slab and their subsequent interaction with the overlying mantle wedge. The Middle−Late Jurassic high-Mg andesite layers within the accretionary complex, along with the previously identified forearc basalts and boninites, indicate a subduction initiation event. Structural analysis reveals that the Late Jurassic−Early Cretaceous deformation of the accretionary complex is primarily characterized by north-dipping thrust faults and locally tight folds. The deformation features, combined with the records of magmatic arcs and sedimentary units, indicate a northward subduction polarity. Consequently, the Bangong-Nujiang Meso-Tethys Ocean experienced at least two episodes of northward subduction initiation. The initial Middle−Late Jurassic subduction may be related to the southward migration of the subduction zone, triggered by the northward accretion of terranes.", "authors": ["Yiming Liu", "Qing‐guo Zhai", "Roberto F.

The research focuses on addressing the challenges faced by construction management teams and exploring the application of BIM and IPD-ish within a construction context. The growing complexity and scale of construction projects necessitate innovative management approaches to ensure efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, there is a gap in literature regarding the integration of BIM and IPD-ish in practical construction scenarios. This study aims to investigate the value of BIM and IPD-ish in construction project management. It seeks to fill the existing gap by examining their combined impact on project outcomes. The research employs a case study methodology, leveraging BIM as a comprehensive data platform. Through this platform, all project variables are integrated, allowing for effective pre-construction control of design changes that could potentially increase overall costs. The study also involves close collaboration among project participants, adhering to IPD-ish principles. The implementation of BIM and IPD-ish led to significant improvements in project delivery, including reduced construction costs, shorter timelines, enhanced quality, and increased productivity. The findings of this study underscore the importance of BIM and IPD-ish in construction project management, particularly for improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The proposed framework offers practical insights for project managers and stakeholders, guiding them towards more successful project outcomes.

We present detailed analyses of high-temperature ductile deformation preserved in drill-core from IODP Hole U1601C, on the Atlantis Massif OCC (30°N, MAR). We show that gabbroic intrusions within peridotite accommodated significant high-temperature deformation, especially within Fe-Ti oxide-bearing assemblages. This deformation spatially localizes in zones of high lithological heterogeneity created by meter-to-submeter-scale gabbroic intrusions within peridotite. High-temperature ductile deformation often localizes close to, and/or along, intrusive contacts, accompanied by localized, evolved, melt-reactive porous flow (crystallizing Fe-Ti oxides), and followed by fluid-rock reaction that enhanced and sustained further ductile deformation. These spatially controlling relationships between magmatism, deformation, and late melt ± fluid infiltration are a direct consequence of the lithological heterogeneity within moderately-magmatic OCCs, which are the dominant style of OCC along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and other slow-spreading ridges.", "authors": ["Andrew J.

However, in actual acquisition processes, problems such as drilling fluid invasion and wellbore collapse often lead to the absence or distortion of logging data, thereby affecting their subsequent analysis and application. Well logging curves exhibit clear context-dependent characteristics. Traditional reconstruction methods are mostly based on the assumption of independent and identically distributed data and are difficult to capture the temporal dependencies between data, resulting in limited accuracy of time series modeling. Therefore, for the shale reservoir in a certain basin in the northeastern region, this paper introduces a method that combines variational mode decomposition (VMD), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (BiLSTM) to achieve high-precision reconstruction of logging acoustic wave signals (DT). The VMD method decomposes the logging curves into different mode functions (IMF), achieving the extraction of features at different scales; the CNN method is used to extract local features such as local morphology and change trends of IMF, obtaining high-level feature representations; the BiLSTM is used to extract the bidirectional long-term dependencies of features. By standardizing the logging data, to avoid the subjectivity of manually selecting the input logging curves, the XGBoost-SHAP method is introduced to optimize the logging curves, and an DT-targeted gradient boosting regression model is constructed using XGBoost, and the SHAP values are used to conduct game theory-based contribution analysis for each input feature, obtaining the feature ranking based on the cumulative SHAP contribution. Finally, three sensitive curves, CNL, GR, and RS, are selected as input features to construct the VMD-CNN-BiLSTM prediction model, which is applied to two test wells, achieving a fitting goodness (R 2 ) of 0.71 and 0.88 respectively. Further comparative experiments have shown that the VMD-CNN-BiLSTM model has significantly improved performance in terms of MSE, MAE, MAPE, R 2 , etc., compared to the SVR, random forest, and LSTM methods.

Many studies have shown that arc magmas are more oxidized and enriched in 34S than mid-ocean ridge basalts, which has been linked to the transfer of slab-derived volatiles, such as sulfate, into the overlying mantle wedge and into arc magmas. However, the transfer mechanisms and the oxidation states of slab fluids is still under debate, and particularly the role of sulfur is currently widely discussed. Here we present bulk rock and in situ sulfur isotope results from metasomatic, eclogitic metagabbros from the Voltri Massif in Italy that are in contact with serpentinites (Schwarzenbach et al., 2024). Previous petrological work of this contact showed that metasomatism by fluid-mediated mass transfer of Mg from the serpentinite into the metagabbro caused formation of actinolite-chlorite schists and metagabbro rich in epidote and Na- and Na-Ca amphiboles along the contact (Codillo et al., 2022). Abundant euhedral to subhedral pyrite in the metasomatized metagabbro show distinct correlations between in situ sulfur isotope analyses and sharp Co and Ni growth zones documenting multiple generations of pyrite formation. In particular, a trend of increasing &amp;#948;34S values from core to rim in pyrite associated with inclusions of distinct high pressure silicate minerals documents the input of 34S-enriched sulfur during metasomatism of the eclogitic metagabbros concurrent to subduction metamorphism. Using thermodynamic modeling our study shows that the infiltrating fluids equilibrated with the serpentinite before entering the metagabbro and that these fluids were HS--bearing. Infiltration of these HS--bearing and 34S-enriched fluids led to redox reactions in the Fe-Ti metagabbro involving sulfur, iron, and likely carbon, and the formation of euhedral pyrite with &amp;#948;34S values of up to 12.5&amp;#8240; in the metasomatized metagabbro. We argue that this process of 34S-enriched sulfur mobilization from serpentinites is pervasive along the plate interface in subduction zones and infer that melting of such metasomatic material can explain the 34S-enriched signatures observed in arc magmas.&amp;#160;References:A.

However, parameters like the speciation of sulfur and the prevailing redox conditions during dehydration-related and fluid-mediated transport are still highly debated. To gain a deeper understanding of sulfur transport, distribution and speciation driven by different fluid migration processes at the blueschist-eclogite facies transition, we investigate samples from the New Caledonian Pou&amp;#233;bo eclogite m&amp;#233;lange (Taetz et al., 2016). These samples comprise two generations of garnet-quartz-bearing veins with adjacent omphacite-rich reaction halos in a blueschist metabasalt matrix. The veins are interpreted as both internal dehydration veins and external transport veins formed during prograde to peak metamorphism of the oceanic slab (Taetz et al., 2016). Therefore, these samples offer an ideal opportunity to link sulfur transport and speciation with different fluid migration processes at HP/LT subduction conditions.Using the sulfur mineral distribution within and at varying distance to the veins, combined with in situ sulfur isotope and sulfide trace element compositions, three generations of pyrite formation and two main stages of sulfur mobilization at peak metamorphic conditions are inferred. The first stage of sulfur mobilization is linked to the formation of dehydration veins at low fO2 conditions, by the breakdown of water-bearing phases. At this stage, the primary wall rock pyrite (&amp;#948;34S = -3.4&amp;#8240; to -35.7&amp;#8240;) is partially leached from the wall rock and reprecipitates as fine-grained pyrite aggregates with &amp;#948;34S values averaging at -12.4&amp;#8240; in and along the newly forming, small-scale quartz-garnet-bearing dehydration veins. The second stage of sulfur mobilization takes place during the infiltration of an external fluid and formation of the transport vein. Due to a significant decrease of sulfide minerals towards the transport vein and the occurrence of Fe-oxide decomposition rims around the selvage pyrites, we infer an oxidizing character of the external fluid. This causes the development of a redox gradient between more oxidizing vein and more reducing matrix during selvage formation and enables sulfur mobilization and oxidation in the selvage area balanced by the reduction of omphacite Fe3+. The absence of sulfur-bearing minerals in the transport vein itself indicates, furthermore, that dissolved sulfate was removed from the investigated vein system by the passing external fluid.Based on the studied vein systems, we imply that in subduction zones at the blueschist-eclogite facies transition fluid-mediated sulfur mobilization and speciation is mainly controlled by the fluid-rock ratio. While internally-buffered rock dehydration fluids carry sulfur in its reduced form, fluid-dominated transport veins may carry sulfur mostly in its oxidized form.&amp;#160;REFERENCESTaetz, S., John, T., Brocker, M., &amp;amp; Spandler, C.

The measurement of the ultra‐trace Ag (&lt; 0.1 μg g ‐1 ) in geological samples by ICP‐MS is often hindered due to serious polyatomic interferences arising from Zr, Nb and Y elements presented in samples. In this study, a simple and rapid ammonia coprecipitation method was developed to remove interference elements (Zr, Nb and Y) in NH 4 HF 2 digests for the determination of Ag mass fractions in geological materials by isotope dilution ICP‐MS (ID‐ICP‐MS). The removal of interference elements (Zr, Nb and Y) in digestion solutions of geological materials was achieved using ammonia coprecipitation, effectively eliminating their polyatomic interferences. To compensate for the incomplete recovery of Ag during ammonia coprecipitation, isotope dilution calibration was chosen over internal standard calibration to achieve final accurate results. The limit of quantitation for Ag using the proposed method was 1.83 ng g ‐1 . The results obtained for Ag mass fractionation in nine international geological reference materials were in good agreement with the published values obtained by ID‐ICP‐MS and ICP‐MS/MS.

Besides being one of the classical minerals datable using the U–Pb system, rutile incorporates a broad range of trace elements, many of those being incompatible in most of the common metamorphic minerals. Although numerous multivariate statistical or machine‐learning tools are available, current rutile discrimination schemes suffer from focusing on uni‐ and bivariate approaches leading to large compositional overlaps. Here we compiled and enlarged a dataset of 2335 rutile trace‐element analyses (1646 new analyses) from 110 metamorphic rock samples of 48 localities covering a wide range of pressure–temperature conditions. After showing that the subsampling and testing strategy of the classical random forest algorithm is inappropriate for such hierarchical data structures, we introduce a modified version (random forests for hierarchically structured data) which provides realistic and generalized error estimates, improving hyperparameter tuning and performance. By applying this concept, we present a novel and multivariate rutile discrimination scheme, using the concentrations of 16 elements. The model correctly predicts the source rock composition (felsic versus mafic) in ~89% of the cases and the metamorphic gradient (≤ 350 °C/GPa versus &gt; 350 °C/GPa) in ~84%. Combined with U–Pb dating, this will enable time‐resolved insights into the geodynamic evolution of the hinterland, taking rutile provenance analysis to the next level. This approach furthermore highlights specific elements and ratios — previously understudied — that reflect bulk‐rock and partitioning effects, making them valuable for future investigation of metamorphic processes.

Here, we integrated petrological and geochemical analyses on this soil and its main components to estimate the compositions of local mare basalt and nonmare components. The landing site basalt is a typical low-Ti basalt with low Mg# (30–31) and low contents of Th (1 ppm) and other incompatible elements. The bulk soil overall shows homogeneous major and trace elemental compositions, which are very different from the local basalt. Combined with petrological constraints, such differences reveal an incorporation of ~40 ± 5 wt% of noritic crust ejecta and 2–3 wt% meteoritic materials, without mantle-rock fragments. The mean composition of nonmare materials corresponds to anorthositic norite or norite (~60 ± 5 vol% plagioclase) and is broadly comparable with Northwest Africa (NWA) 2995 clan meteorites and the prediction from remote sensing data for the SPA basin. The low-Th contents of the basalt, soil, breccia, and impact glasses (1–2 ppm) support negligible Th-rich components in ejecta materials and the underlying mantle and crust.

Incipient melts from mantle peridotite melting are highly mobile and tend to quickly escape from their sources; however, it remains enigmatic how the LVZ can extend to the depths where partial melting initiates. Here, we identify a suite of primitive low-MgO basalts derived from an eclogitized oceanic crust at ~200 km within the LVZ, providing a compelling scenario for the LVZ formation. These primitive basalts exhibit significantly heavier Fe isotopes and lighter Ca-Mo-O isotopes compared to mid-ocean-ridge basalts, indicating that they originated from eclogitized oceanic crust rather than peridotite. This highlights the fact that oceanic crust recycled into the mantle can melt to form primitive Mg-poor and Si-rich melts.

This study examines the petrogenesis of anorthosites and noritic anorthosites from the lunar farside using samples collected by the CE-6 mission. The analysis reveals that the ferroan anorthosite (FAN) clasts display plagioclase An# and mafic mineral Mg# within the range of Apollo FANs, highlighting the compositional similarity between the lunar nearside and farside. The identification of FANs on the farside underscores the global nature of these lithologies, indicating that the early lunar crust formation processes were not confined to the nearside but were widespread across the Moon. The noritic anorthosite clast shows characteristics consistent with KREEP-free/poor Mg-suite rocks. This finding supports the idea that both the nearside and farside experienced similar magmatic processes, challenging the simplistic hemispheric dichotomy models.

Garnet is commonly used to calculate pressure (P)-temperature (T) histories of metamorphic rocks, as well as to monitor changes in bulk-rock composition (X) and deformation (d). In situ U-Pb geochronology by laser ablation-inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is a rapid and relatively high spatial resolution technique, which can be used to constrain the timing of the metamorphic P–T–X–d histories preserved in garnet. However, the low U contents (low µg/g to ng/g levels) of most common metamorphic garnet crystals presents unique analytical challenges, including potential contamination of the U-Pb system by high-U inclusions, such as zircon, rutile, and monazite. Here we use LA split-stream (SS)-ICPMS analysis to simultaneously measure the U, Th, and Pb isotopes and trace-element contents of eclogite-facies garnet from metamafic rocks at As Sifah, Oman. We observe abundant zircon micro-inclusions (&lt;2 µm) in all five dated samples. Strong linear correlations in U vs Zr contents in the analysed laser-ablation spots plot along garnet–zircon mixing lines, the slopes of which can only be explained by zircon contamination. Despite clear zircon contamination in the trace-element data, the time-resolved laser-ablation U and Pb signals show some irregularities but lack sharp diagnostic spikes typically indicative of inclusions. Instead, zircon micro-inclusions are sufficiently small, abundant, and dispersed over the scale of the laser spot site (193 μm diameter) such that their contribution to the U, Th, and Pb signals is diluted to produce irregular time-resolved signals that have previously not been identified as inclusions. Analyses affected by contamination result in well-defined U-Pb regression lines that give concordia intercept dates of 94–89 Ma. After screening, only one sample had sufficient inclusion-free analyses and spread in U-Pb ratios to calculate a statistically meaningful date. The calculated concordia intercept date of 71 ± 7 Ma is consistent within uncertainty of previously published garnet–whole rock Sm-Nd peak metamorphic ages. We suggest that the 94–89 Ma ages represent the growth of micro-zircons produced during low-grade metamorphism or hydrothermal alteration of the mafic tuff protolith during the submergence of and sediment deposition on the Arabian margin at this time. To obviate the effect of micro-inclusions in garnet LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronology, we recommend a careful examination of garnet grains by electron microscopy prior to analysis and determination of background garnet U, Th, Pb contents and Th/U combined with the rejection of analyses with even slight or moderately irregular signals. We also demonstrate that LASS-ICPMS is a powerful tool to screen for inclusion contamination for in situ U-Pb garnet geochronology, providing confidence in the geologic meaning of the resulting ages.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

While detrital zircon mostly derives from felsic igneous rocks and tourmaline is hardly datable, rutile is mainly sourced from metamorphic rocks and routinely datable by U&amp;#8722;Pb chronology. Thus, combining detrital rutile age information with trace-element based discrimination of different metamorphic source rocks has a high potential to gain time-resolved insights into the geodynamic evolution of the hinterland. However, trace-element based approaches are so far limited to (i) bivariate discrimination of mafic and felsic metamorphic source rocks by considering Cr and Nb concentrations (Zack et al. 2004a; Meinhold et al. 2008; Triebold et al. 2007, 2012), (ii) temperature information by considering Zr concentrations (e.g., Zack et al. 2004b; Kohn 2020) and assuming the same pressure conditions for all detrital grains, (iii) identification of fluid alteration based on e.g., W, Sn, V, Sb, Cr, Nb, Fe (Agangi et al. 2020; Pereira et al. 2021; Pereira &amp;amp; Storey 2023); and (iv) identifying very specific sources like mafic low-temperature/high-pressure rocks by considering H2O concentrations in combination with Zr, Nb, W, and Sn (Lueder et al. 2024).Here we compiled a dataset of 2,335 rutile trace-element analyses (16 elements) from 110 metamorphic rock samples of a wide range of pressure&amp;#8722;temperature conditions.

Garnet is commonly used to calculate pressure (P)–temperature (T) histories of metamorphic rocks, as well as to monitor changes in bulk-rock composition (X) and deformation (d). In situ U–Pb geochronology by laser ablation–inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is a rapid and relatively high spatial resolution technique, which can be used to constrain the timing of the metamorphic P–T–X–d histories preserved in garnet. However, the low U contents (low µg g−1 to ng g−1 levels) of most common metamorphic garnet crystals present unique analytical challenges, including potential contamination of the U–Pb system by high-U inclusions, such as zircon, rutile, monazite, and apatite. Here we use laser ablation split-stream (LASS) ICPMS (LASS-ICPMS) analysis to simultaneously measure the U, Th, and Pb isotopes and trace-element contents of eclogite-facies garnet from metamafic rocks at As Sifah, Oman. We observe abundant zircon micro-inclusions (&lt;2 µm) in all five dated samples. Strong linear correlations in U vs. Zr contents in the analysed laser ablation spots plot along garnet–zircon mixing lines, the slopes of which can only be explained by zircon contamination. Despite clear zircon contamination in the trace-element data, the time-resolved laser ablation U and Pb signals show some irregularities but lack sharp diagnostic spikes typically indicative of inclusions. Instead, zircon micro-inclusions are sufficiently small, abundant, and dispersed over the scale of the laser spot site (193 µm diameter) such that their contributions to the U, Th, and Pb signals are diluted to produce irregular time-resolved signals that have previously not been identified as inclusions. Analyses affected by contamination result in well-defined U–Pb regression lines that give concordia intercept dates of 94–89 Ma. After screening, only one sample had sufficient inclusion-free analyses and spread in U–Pb ratios to calculate a statistically meaningful garnet U–Pb date. The calculated concordia intercept date of 71±7 Ma is consistent within uncertainty of previously published garnet–whole-rock Sm–Nd peak metamorphic ages. We suggest that the 94–89 Ma ages represent the growth of micro-zircons produced during low-grade metamorphism or hydrothermal alteration of the mafic tuff protolith during the submergence of and sediment deposition on the Arabian margin at this time. To obviate the effect of micro-inclusions in garnet LA-ICPMS U–Pb geochronology, we recommend a careful examination of garnet grains by electron microscopy prior to analysis and determination of background garnet U, Th, and Pb contents and Th/U combined with the rejection of analyses with even slight or moderately irregular signals. We also demonstrate that LASS-ICPMS is a powerful tool to screen for inclusion contamination for in situ U–Pb garnet geochronology, providing confidence in the geologic meaning of the resulting ages.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

Specifically, cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) form interwoven skeletons by non‐directional freeze drying. Crucially, the rhamnolipid surfactant assists in forming stable and uniform bubbles, and drives the regularization of frame structure during the freezing process, promoting the construction of refined mechanical structures. Besides, the interfacial enhancement by esterification reaction of citric acid and the encapsulation by hydrophobic silane via chemical vapor deposition endow aerogels with better resilience and water tolerance. The as‐prepared aerogels can withstand intensive compression cycle tests and possess the ability to rebound over 10 times underwater. Even after 12 h wet treatment, the strain and stress loss respectively decrease by ≈55.5% and ≈14% compare with the initial unregulated aerogels after 500 cycles of 80% compression.

Active tectonic margins, however, are subjected to non‐hydrostatic stresses wherein stress magnitudes vary directionally, and the impact of non‐hydrostatic stress on mineral chemistry is uncertain. The work of materials scientists F. Larché and J. Cahn provides a framework for quantifying how stress affects mineral chemistry. Crystallographically and mechanically anisotropic, multicomponent minerals will have different compositions as a function of their orientation under a fixed stress meaning that grain‐to‐grain compositional variation can be used to estimate stress. We develop two “orientation piezometry” methods that use the chemistry and orientations of multicomponent, anisotropic minerals to estimate stress. The first method uses chemistry and orientation (“coupled orientation piezometry”) whereas the second method uses composition alone (“decoupled orientation piezometry”). We apply the methods to clinopyroxene and feldspar solid solutions using synthetic data sets. The first method determines the full stress tensor whereas the second method can only determine the differential stress magnitude unless additional a priori information is specified. Plausible scenarios for orientation piezometry include minerals undergoing diffusion creep, recrystallized grains formed during dislocation creep, and minerals grown statically under stress. Preliminary application of the decoupled piezometer to the famous eclogite facies shear zones on Holsnøy, Norway, suggests differential stresses in the range of 300–900 MPa, broadly consistent with previous estimates from the area. Thus, orientation piezometry techniques may provide valuable constraints on geodynamic processes and insights into long‐standing geological problems such as the relationship between pressure and depth.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hess", "Jay J.

Whether this structural context impacts the geochemistry of hydrothermal fluids, including their copper contents, remains unknown. Here, we investigate the copper concentration and helium isotope signature of geothermal fluids as modern analogs of hydrothermal ore deposits in the Andes of central-southern Chile. We show that fault systems broadly parallel to the regional stress field facilitate the early release of fluids from deep primitive magmas. By contrast, fault systems oblique to the regional stress field prevent the early escape of fluids and promote magmatic enrichment in copper, volatiles, and ligands, enhancing the potential to form copper deposits. We conclude that the orientation of fault systems actively influences the copper budget of ascending hydrothermal fluids, explaining the contrasting distribution of metals along distinct structures often observed in porphyry-epithermal systems and other types of magmatic-hydrothermal deposits.", "authors": ["Daniele Tardani", "Santiago Tassara", "Pablo Sánchez-Alfaro", "Martín Reich", "Pamela Pérez-Flóres", "Philippe Robidoux", "Claudio Contreras", "Daniele L.

These SPCEs have been studied for their molecular structure, adsorption behavior in cement paste, and influence of silane content on rheological performance of cement paste and concrete. The experimental findings indicate that while SPCEs exhibit a slightly diminished water reduction rate, the viscosity of cement paste with SPCEs is lower compared to conventional polycarboxylate superplasticizer with equivalent fluidity. This is attributed to their enhanced adsorption capacity, reduced intrinsic viscosity, and smaller hydrodynamic radius. Compared to the control group, the concrete made with SPCE showed a decrease of 23.53% and 11.00% in the outflow times of T500 and V-funnel, respectively, along with a reduction of 19.43% in plastic viscosity.

However, reading this record requires a robust understanding of titanium (Ti) substitution mechanisms and solubility in garnet. To this end, we examine the Ti substitution systematics revealed by 87 garnet analyses from previously published experimental studies relevant for granulites, high-pressure granulites, and deep crustal magmatic rocks. The experimental P-T conditions range mostly between 850–1230 °C and 1.0–2.7 GPa; four 3.2 GPa, 1075–1150 °C ultrahigh-P, ultrahigh-T examples are also included. We find that normalizing garnet formulas based on two octahedral sites per 12 O atoms provides better Fe3+ estimates than the standard 8-total-cation scheme. The Fe3+ must be constrained as both it and Ti substitute on octahedral sites. Graphical analysis reveals that the main substitutions are Tschermak-Ti (VITi4+ + IVAl3+ ↔ VIAl3+ + IVSi4+) and andradite (VIAl3+ ↔ VIFe3+), with lesser but nonetheless important contributions by andradite-Ti (VITi4+ + IVAl3+ ↔ VIFe3+ + IVSi4+) and alkali-Ti (VITi4+ + VIII(Na+,K+) ↔ VIAl3+ + VIIIM2+). Here, VIIIM2+ denotes dodecahedrally coordinated divalent cations (Ca, Fe2+, Mg, Mn). We also posit a small role for Ti substitution coupled to dodecahedral vacancies. These inferences were independently tested using a Monte Carlo modeling procedure developed herein that quantitatively reproduces both the nature and extent of the observed substitutions. We also compared the experimental data with a representative suite of natural garnet analyses. In general, the natural garnets have far lower Ti and alkali (Na ± K) contents than the experimental ones. We attribute this to Ti and alkali loss in nature during exhumation and cooling by processes including diffusion and interface-coupled dissolution-reprecipitation. Some fraction of the lost Ti can be hosted by exsolved precipitates of crystallographically oriented rutile ± ilmenite. However, in many cases, these are absent, and the Ti must have left the garnet structure entirely. The lost alkalis may be hosted by exsolved amphibole or mica precipitates, but these are relatively uncommon, suggesting that alkalis are typically transferred from garnet to the matrix or to non-precipitate inclusions.", "authors": ["Jay J.

Serpentinization frequently results in the production of secondary magnetite that records the direction of the Earth&amp;#8217;s magnetic field at the time of its formation, allowing paleomagnetism to be used as a tool to investigate this process.&amp;#160;Many ophiolites also experienced large-scale tectonic rotations during their evolution. In some cases, the timing of these rotations is well-documented paleomagnetically, potentially allowing the timing of different phases of serpentinization to be constrained if the magnetization directions of secondary magnetite assemblages can be determined and compared to known rotation histories. Here we present the first attempt to combine paleomagnetic analysis with Quantum Diamond Microscopy (QDM) observations of individual magnetic grain assemblages to test whether sequential phases of alteration can be dated in serpentinized peridotites in this way.&amp;#160;We focus on the Late Cretaceous Troodos ophiolite of Cyprus that underwent a ~90 CCW tectonic rotation that began shortly after it formed by seafloor spreading. The timing of this rotation is well-constrained by paleomagnetic analysis of the sedimentary rocks that were deposited continuously while the underlying oceanic crust rotated. In this context, different magnetization directions would be expected to be carried by magnetite assemblages produced by serpentinization during: (i) early exposure on the seafloor or deep fluid circulation during Late Cretaceous seafloor spreading; (ii) subsequent progressive tectonic rotation; and (iii) Plio-Quaternary to Recent tectonic uplift and/or reaction with modern meteoric water.Magnetization directions within the Troodos serpentinites are shown to be highly variable, and include: (i) samples carrying W-directed, high-coercivity components, inferred to be acquired in the Late Cretaceous, and NNW-N-directed, low-coercivity overprints, inferred to be acquired post-rotation; (ii) samples with single component, NW-directed magnetizations, inferred to have been acquired partway through the rotation; (iii) samples with single component, N-directed magnetizations inferred to have been acquired post-rotation; and (iv) one site where samples exhibit antipodal normal and reversed polarity, N-S-directed magnetizations inferred to have been acquired post-rotation but before the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal (780 ka). Overall, these data demonstrate that serpentinization occurred throughout the entire history of the Troodos Ophiolite, with six sites showing evidence of serpentinization in the Late Cretaceous or partway through the rotation and six sites where serpentinization occurred post-rotation from the Eocene to the present day. QDM data from one site where samples exhibit a W-directed ChRM and a NNW-N-directed overprint confirm that all observed magnetite associated with serpentine veins carries the early ChRM, inferred to be acquired during the Late Cretaceous. The source of the low stability component in these samples was not observed in QDM images and remains elusive, but is interpreted to be a modern magnetic overprint.", "authors": ["James Hepworth", "Antony Morris", "Michelle Harris", "Alec R.

Their formation is not well understood due to low silica solubility in carbonatite melts and negligible amounts of silicate minerals on carbonatite melt cotectics at upper crustal conditions. We explore whether silicocarbonatites can be thought of as antiskarns: rocks formed by leaching of SiO 2 from siliceous wall rocks by carbonatite melts, and its deposition as solid silicate minerals by reaction with chemical components already present in the carbonatite melt. Solid state thermodynamic modelling at 1–5 kbar and 500–800 °C predicts that calcite–dolomite–magnetite assemblages will transform to dolomite-free silicocarbonatites with an increase in silica contents. In sodic systems, the formation of aegirine and alkali amphiboles suppresses silica activity despite elevated silica contents. Therefore, dolomite remains stable, but Fe 3+ is consumed, firstly from magnetite breakdown, and secondly by coupled Fe oxidation and reduction of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 , and graphite, particularly at higher pressures. Despite a net increase in Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ , the system evolves to increasingly lower oxygen fugacity. In aluminous systems, nepheline indicates high temperatures whereas alkali feldspars form at lower temperatures. Modelling of potassic systems demonstrates stability of mostly phlogopite-rich biotites, leading to Fe 2+ increase in all other carbonate and silicate phases. We find that perthites are expected in high pressures whereas two feldspars are more likely in lower pressures. Aspects of the clinopyroxene natural compositional trend (diopside to hedenbergite to aegirine) of carbonatite systems can be explained by silica contamination. Ferrous clinopyroxenes typically require low alumina and are predicted in potassic or low temperature sodic systems, primarily at mid to high pressures. Silica contamination permits the formation of silicocarbonatite-like assemblages in a way that is not limited by SiO 2 solubility in carbonatite melts. Glimmerites and clinopyroxene-rich rocks (such as the ijolite series) that often occur around carbonatite rocks at the contact with silica-oversaturated wall rocks can be explained as the extreme end of silica contamination of carbonatite melts. Therefore, these clinopyroxenites and glimmerites can form solely via metasomatic processes without the presence of a silicate melt.", "authors": ["Michael Anenburg", "Jesse B.

Metasomatized Mantle", "abstract": "Abstract Mantle metasomatism, which affects the geochemical and lithological properties of the Earth, is crucial to the evolution and modification of the Earth's interior. Variations in chemical proxy of metasomatism, including high‐field strength elements (HFSE, e.g., Zr‐Ti isotopes and isovalent Zr‐Hf), have been commonly utilized as a tool to unravel the processes associated with the evolution of the Earth. However, the impact of mantle metasomatism by diverse agents on the Zr isotopic compositions of metasomatized mantle remains poorly understood. Here we carried out high‐precision double‐spike δ 94/90 Zr measurements for a suite of basalts, which were derived from the mantle sources metasomatized by typical metasomatic agents of fluid, silicate melt and carbonate melt originating from the deep mantle or recycled crustal materials. Mantle metasomatism results in lithological diversities within the mantle, ranging from hybridized peridotites to pyroxenite/eclogite and carbonated eclogite, which can significantly fractionate the isovalent HFSEs. However, our data show that these basalts have primitive mantle‐like δ 94 Zr NIST values (−0.033–0.043 ‰), regardless of their superchondritic Zr/Hf. The primitive mantle‐like δ 94 Zr NIST , irrelevant to any proxy of metasomatism (e.g., Sr‐Nd isotopes, Zr/Hf and La/Sm), indicate that mantle metasomatism and subsequence melting produce no measurable Zr isotopic variations in metasomatized mantle‐derived basalts. The δ 94 Zr NIST of basalts thus can be representative of the mean metasomatized mantle compositions. Combined with previously reported komatiites and oceanic basalts, we show that the Earth's mantle displays consistent δ 94 Zr NIST (−0.013 ± 0.053 ‰), even if it has a secular dynamic evolution with the interaction between Earth's exterior and interior.", "authors": ["Zongqi Zou", "Yi‐Gang Xu", "Zaicong Wang", "Chuyu Hu", "Lanping Feng", "Jingliang Guo", "Wen Zhang", "Liang Ma", "Zhaochu Hu", "Yongsheng Liu"], "doi": "10.1029/2023jb028137", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1029/2023jb028137", "published": "2024-02-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "交代地幔的稳定锆同位素组成", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在探究不同交代作用对交代地幔锆同位素组成的影响，此前对此了解甚少。", "methodology": "采用高精度双稀释剂δ94/90 Zr测量技术，分析了受流体、硅酸盐熔体和碳酸盐熔体等典型交代剂影响的玄武岩样品。", "key_findings": "交代地幔来源的玄武岩具有原始地幔般的δ94 Zr值，表明交代作用和随后的熔融不引起可测量的锆同位素变化。", "innovation": "首次揭示了地幔交代作用对锆同位素组成无显著影响，且地球地幔的δ94 Zr值在长期演化中保持一致。", "relevance_note": "这项研究为理解地幔交代作用中锆同位素的行为提供了新视角，并支持锆同位素作为地幔平均组成的代表。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1029/2024je008584", "title": "Tadpole‐Shaped Nanoparticles in Impact Melt and Implication of High Temperature Chemical Garden in Lunar Soil", "abstract": "Abstract Nanoparticles within lunar soil grains are a primary product of space weathering. The microstructural and chemical characteristics of the nanoparticles are diverse and their formation mechanisms are still under debate. In this paper, for the first time, tadpole‐shaped nanoparticles (with Fe‐Ni(‐S) head and Fe‐Ti‐O tail) were found in the impact melt glass spherule of an agglutinate in the returned Chang'e‐5 lunar soil, and their possible formation mechanisms were discussed. In terms of the Fe‐Ni(‐S) “head” formation mechanisms, they probably produced by shock‐induced dissemination. Another possibility is that the Fe‐Ni(‐S) heads were derived from the impact glass due to liquid immiscibility. The S degassing of FeS was contributed to nanophase Fe‐Ni metal. For the Fe‐Ti‐O tails, they are devitrified ilmenites, nucleated as a result of the passage of the Fe nanoparticles through the melt. These nanoparticles formed though impact‐induced nonequilibrium growth and recorded the movement and migration of the Fe‐Ni‐S nanoparticles within the melt.

Sr-Nd同位素两端元混合模拟显示,鲁西北部火山岩EMⅠ型同位素特征可能与其地幔源区受华北下地壳物质的交代有关,而鲁西中-南部、郯庐断裂带和胶东地区火山岩EMⅡ型同位素特点则更可能是源区受三叠纪俯冲扬子陆壳组分改造的结果. 古太平洋板块来源的俯冲流体交代和水化也对这些地区的富集岩石圈地幔有不同程度改造. 因此,山东半岛不同地区早白垩世火山岩记录了不同性质壳源组分对华北克拉通东部岩石圈地幔的影响,这一差异性改造对华北东部岩石圈地幔的破坏和减薄有重要制约作用. 关键词: 早白垩世 / 中基性火山岩 / 富集岩石圈地幔 / 地幔交代 / 华北克拉通 / 地球化学", "authors": ["Lang Wang", "Huayun Tang", "Xiang Wang", "Keqing Zong", "Jingliang Guo", "Huai Cheng", "Zaicong Wang"], "doi": "10.3799/dqkx.2022.340", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3799/dqkx.2022.340", "published": "2024-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Earth Science-Journal of China University of Geosciences", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "华北克拉通东部早白垩世火山岩：再循环物质差异性改造的记录", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "探讨华北克拉通东部早白垩世火山岩源区性质及其不均一性的成因。", "methodology": "采用地球化学特征和Sr-Nd同位素组成对比研究，并进行Sr-Nd同位素两端元混合模拟。", "key_findings": "火山岩源于富集地幔，受再循环地壳物质改造，富集程度西北向东南增强；EM1型与华北下地壳有关，EM2型与扬子陆壳俯冲有关。", "innovation": "揭示了华北克拉通东部不同地区地幔源区受不同性质再循环地壳物质差异性改造的模式。", "relevance_note": "该研究为理解华北克拉通东部岩石圈地幔破坏和减薄机制提供了关键制约。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.46427/gold2024.23412", "title": "The behavior of chalcophile elements during the differentiation of two distinct magma series from the Central Andes", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Kang Chen", "Suzanne Mahlburg Kay", "Zaicong Wang"], "doi": "10.46427/gold2024.23412", "url": "https://doi.org/10.46427/gold2024.23412", "published": "2024-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": null, "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "Central Andes两种不同岩浆系列分异过程中亲硫元素的行为", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文研究了中安第斯山脉两种不同岩浆系列分异过程中亲硫元素的行为。", "methodology": "论文可能通过对中安第斯山脉两种岩浆系列岩石的地球化学分析，研究亲硫元素的演化。", "key_findings": "核心发现将揭示中安第斯山脉两种岩浆系列分异过程中亲硫元素的具体演化模式和差异。", "innovation": "创新点可能在于首次详细比较了中安第斯山脉两种不同岩浆系列中亲硫元素的行为，揭示其分异机制。", "relevance_note": "该研究有助于深入理解岩浆分异过程中亲硫元素的地球化学循环，对矿床成因研究具有重要意义。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.5194/egusphere-egu24-2982", "title": "Predicting Sulfide Precipitation in Magma Oceans on Earth, Mars, and the Moon Using Machine Learning", "abstract": "The sulfur content at sulfide saturation (SCSS) in silicate melts plays a pivotal role in governing the behavior of chalcophile elements in planetary magma oceans. Numerous high-pressure experiments have been conducted to determine SCSS, employing various regression methods to capture the thermodynamic characteristics of the system. However, existing empirical equations have shown limited predictive accuracy when applied to laboratory measurements. In this study, we have compiled and analyzed 542 experimental datasets encompassing diverse sulfide and silicate compositions under varying pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions (up to 24 GPa and 2673 K). Employing empirical equations, linear regression, Random Forest algorithms, and a novel hybrid approach combining empirical fits for P-T conditions with Random Forest modeling for compositions, we have developed multiple SCSS models. These models have been rigorously compared with laboratory measurements. Our findings reveal that the Random Forest and hybrid models exhibit exceptional predictive performance (R2 = 0.82&amp;#8211;0.91, mean average error [MAE] &lt; 746 ppmw S, residual mean standard error [RMSE] &lt; 972 ppmw S) in comparison to previous empirical models (R2 = 0.28&amp;#8211;0.69, MAE = 622&amp;#8211;1,170 ppmw S, RMSE = 1,070&amp;#8211;1,744 ppmw S). Linear regression falls in between the performance of classical and machine learning models. Furthermore, we have applied our hybrid model to predict SCSS during the solidification of magma oceans on Earth, Mars, and the Moon. A comparison of our model results with expected sulfur contents in residual magma oceans, calculated through mass balance, offers valuable insights. Our analysis confirms that sulfides precipitated during the early accretion phases of Earth and Mars, but not on the Moon. Subsequently, evolving compositions of magma oceans offset increasing sulfur concentrations, preventing sulfide precipitation during intermediate stages of crystallization. Late-stage sulfide precipitation, contributing significantly to the bulk-silicate sulfur abundances of Earth, Mars, and the Moon, occurred at shallow depths (120&amp;#8211;220 km, 40&amp;#8211;320 km, and", "authors": ["J.

Excessive mitophagy is a hallmark in Cd‐induced hepatotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a key regulator for mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis. Here, Cd exposure upregulated MCU expression and increased mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake are found. MCU inhibition through siRNA or by Ru360 significantly attenuates Cd‐induced excessive mitophagy, thereby rescues mitochondrial dysfunction and increases hepatocyte viability. Heterozygous MCU knockout mice exhibit improved liver function, ameliorated pathological damage, less mitochondrial fragmentation, and mitophagy after Cd exposure. Mechanistically, Cd upregulates MCU expression through phosphorylation activation of cAMP‐response element binding protein at Ser133(CREB S133 ) and subsequent binding of MCU promoter at the TGAGGTCT, ACGTCA, and CTCCGTGATGTA regions, leading to increased MCU gene transcription. The upregulated MCU intensively interacts with voltage‐dependent anion‐selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1), enhances its dimerization and ubiquitination, resulting in excessive mitophagy. This study reveals a novel mechanism, through which Cd upregulates MCU to enhance mitophagy and hepatotoxicity.", "authors": ["Cong Liu", "Huijuan Li", "Weixia Duan", "Yu Duan", "Qin Yu", "Tian Zhang", "Ya‐Pei Sun", "Yuanyuan Li", "Yongsheng Liu", "Shangcheng Xu"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202203869", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202203869", "published": "2023-01-15T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Advanced Science", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "MCU上调通过促进VDAC1二聚化和泛素化过度激活线粒体自噬，在镉致肝毒性中的作用", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "镉诱导肝毒性中线粒体自噬过度的潜在机制是什么？", "methodology": "采用siRNA、药物抑制、MCU基因敲除小鼠模型、分子生物学和蛋白质相互作用分析。", "key_findings": "镉通过CREB S133 磷酸化上调MCU表达，MCU与VDAC1相互作用增强其二聚化和泛素化，导致线粒体自噬过度和肝毒性。", "innovation": "揭示了镉通过上调MCU促进VDAC1二聚化和泛素化，从而过度激活线粒体自噬并导致肝毒性的新机制。", "relevance_note": "本研究为镉诱导肝毒性中线粒体自噬过度的机制提供了新见解，有助于开发潜在治疗策略。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1007/s11430-023-1170-y", "title": "Water: The lifeblood of the Earth-human system revealed in elemental correlations", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Zimeng Wang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Anhuai Lu", "Yanxin Wang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11430-023-1170-y", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-023-1170-y", "published": "2023-09-19T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Science China Earth Sciences", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "水：地球-人类系统的命脉——元素相关性揭示", "domain": "水文地质学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在通过元素相关性揭示水在地球-人类系统中的核心作用和生命线地位。", "methodology": "研究采用分析元素相关性的方法，以阐明水对地球和人类系统元素循环的影响。", "key_findings": "核心发现是水通过其对元素分布和循环的深刻影响，作为连接地球与人类系统的关键介质。", "innovation": "创新点在于通过元素相关性提供了一个新颖的视角，量化并阐明了水作为地球-人类系统生命线的角色。", "relevance_note": "本研究对地球化学、环境科学和地球系统科学领域的研究者具有重要价值，因为它揭示了水在元素循环中的基础作用。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1016/j.chemgeo.2023.121568", "title": "Sulfur isotope evidence from peridotite enclaves in southern West Greenland for recycling of surface material into Eoarchean depleted mantle domains", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Jennifer A.

Six Cpx‐matrix RMs were prepared by mixing metallic oxides with GSP‐2 (granodiorite) or pure L‐SVEC solution and melting them into glasses (GSP‐2 + oxide; L‐SVEC + oxide).

However, it can yield timescale estimates for orogenic events that are considerably shorter than those obtained via isotopic geochronology. One potential explanation for the discrepancy is that diffusion of species with different molar volumes may generate intracrystalline, compositional stresses that limit diffusional relaxation. Here, we show that compositional stress can increase the interpreted timescales of lithospheric processes by an order of magnitude or more by investigating a well-characterized garnet from the Barrovian sillimanite zone, Scotland. The garnet records sharp micrometer-scale variations in calcium and iron contents that standard diffusion treatments predict should relax in 1–10 kyr during peak thermal metamorphism. Conversely, compositional stress allows these features to persist for &gt;100 kyr timescales, consistent with independent estimates from strontium-in-apatite tracer diffusion chronometry.

The geometric models of the upper crown clearance, lower band clearance, and pressure balance pipes were also built. The SST turbulence model was used in the CFD setup to numerically simulate the flow in the Francis turbine with different runner installation sinking values. The results show that the hydraulic axial force on the inner surface of the runner remains stable when the runner is lowered. The hydraulic axial force on the entire runner surface and the outer surface of the lower band decreases, and the hydraulic axial force on the outer surface of the upper crown clearance increases. All of these hydraulic axial forces gradually tend to stabilize as the amount descending from the runner increases. To study the reasons for the changes in hydraulic axial forces, the streamlines and fluid fields of different sections in the flow passage were analyzed in detail. It was found that periodic changes of vortices were generated in the clearance due to the influences of the geometric shape and wall rotation. These vortices affect the distribution of velocity and pressure and, thus, determine the hydraulic axial forces. The runner axial installation deviation has little influence on the streamlines, pressure, and velocity distribution in each flow passage, and only changes the velocity and pressure in the upper crown clearance and lower band clearance. Therefore, the axial installation deviation of the runner has a great effect on the hydraulic axial force on the outer surface of the upper crown and lower band and has a smaller impact on the runner passage and the hydraulic axial force on the inner surface of the runner.

Previous studies have reported that CKI regulates cell apoptosis by downregulating the PI3K/Akt pathway. The present study aimed to determine whether CKI alleviates heart failure (HF) by attenuating cardiomyocyte apoptosis via the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Angiotensin II (Ang II) was used to elicit HF, and osmotic minipumps with either Ang II (2 µg/kg/day) or phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS; 200 µl) were subcutaneously implanted into 6‑week‑old male C57BL/6 mice for 3 weeks. In addition, PBS or CKI (25 mg/kg/day) were subcutaneously infused once a day for 3 weeks. Echocardiography was used to examine hemodynamics. The myocardial injury biomarkers, cardiac troponin I and N‑terminal (NT)‑pro hormone B‑type natriuretic peptide, were assessed using enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the morphology of the myocardium. The rate of apoptosis was detected using TUNEL staining and flow cytometry (FCM), and the expression levels of apoptosis‑related proteins were measured using western blot (WB) analysis. Moreover, H9C2 cells were treated with CKI (2 mg/ml) or LY294002 (an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway; 25 µmol/l) in combination with Ang II (1 µmol/l) for 48 h. Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay, FCM and WB analysis were performed in the H9C2 cells to examine cell viability, cell cycle distribution and representative signaling proteins. It was found that CKI promoted healthy cardiac function, reduced myocardial structural damage and reduced the rate of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. CKI markedly attenuated the expression of apoptosis‑related proteins in the PI3K/Akt pathway. The results of the <i>in vitro</i> experiments indicated that CKI promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and inhibited apoptosis, similar to LY294002. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that CKI reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis, promotes healthy cardiac function and attenuates Ang II‑mediated HF.

Diffusion is typically modeled using gradients in chemical potential. However, chemical potential is derived for uniform pressure and temperature conditions and therefore cannot be used to model diffusion when there are gradients in stress. Internal stress variations in minerals create gradients in strain energy which will drive diffusion. Consequently, it is necessary to have a method that incorporates stress variations into diffusion models. We derive a flux expression that allows diffusion to be modeled in ionic, crystalline solids under arbitrary stress states. Our derivation utilizes gradients in a thermodynamic potential called relative chemical potential which quantifies changes in free energy due to the exchanges of constituents on lattice sites under arbitrary stress conditions. We apply our derivation to the common quaternary garnet solid solution almandine-pyrope-grossular-spessartine. The rates and directions of divalent cation diffusion in response to stress are determined by endmember molar volume or lattice parameters, elastic moduli, and non-ideal activity interaction parameters. Our results predict that internal stress variations of one hundred MPa or more are required to shift garnet compositions by at least a few hundredths of a mole fraction. Mineral inclusions in garnet present a potential environment to test and apply our stress-driven diffusion approach, as stress variations ranging from hundreds of MPa to GPa-level are observed or predicted around such inclusions. The ability to model stress-induced diffusion may provide new information about the magnitudes of both intracrystalline stresses and the timescales during which they occurred, imparting a better understanding of large-scale tectono-metamorphic processes.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hess", "Jay J.

It has been suggested that continental intraplate alkaline magmas undergo early sulfide saturation. However, there is a lack of evidence linking erupted magmas to their cumulative counterparts. We examined the petrography and chalcophile and platinum group element (PGE) geochemistry of sodic and potassic differentiation lineage lavas and cumulate autoliths from The Pleiades, an intraplate alkaline volcanic field in northern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The presence of sulfide minerals and depleted PGE contents in mafic lavas show they were saturated in sulfide from the initial stages of magma differentiation. The sodic lineage lavas and their kaersutite gabbro autoliths have abundant sulfides associated with fractionation of titanomagnetite and kaersutite. Their presence is consistent with the chalcophile element geochemistry of the lavas. In the potassic lineage lavas, petrography of autoliths indicates that the sulfides are more abundant in kaersutite diorite than wehrlite, olivine essexite, olivine diorite, and syenite autoliths. Kaersutite is not a phenocryst phase in the potassic lineage but crystallized via in situ replacement of the precursor olivine and augite. During the kaersutite formation, sulfides were precipitated from the interstitial silicate melt. The melt was sulfide oversaturated due to temperature decrease, and compositional variations (mainly SiO2, ΣFeO, Fe3+/ΣFe ratio). The mantle-like isotope compositions of Cu, Zn, and S in the potassic lineage confirms a magmatic origin of the sulfides. The magmatic sulfides from The Pleiades are characterized by depleted PGE, Au and Cu contents. Fractional crystallization models show that early sulfide saturation led to impoverishment of chalcophile metals in The Pleiades magmatic system. This phenomenon may be common in continental intraplate alkaline magmas ascending through thick crusts.", "authors": ["Jihyuk Kim", "Mi Jung Lee", "Jong Ik Lee", "Philip R.

To determine precise and accurate silver isotopic data in silicates, we have modified the traditional pretreatment procedures, assessed isobaric interference and matrix effects, and analyzed silver isotopic compositions in silicates. By modification of the silicate digestion and ion-exchange procedures, efficient elution of silver was achieved. The doping experimental results indicated that the matrix effect induced by Ti and Cr could be satisfactorily corrected using the internal standard Pd isotope pair of 108Pd–106Pd. The modified chemical chromatographic method effectively separates Ni from Ag in silicate samples, thereby minimizing the significant isobaric interference from Ni cations. As a result, the shifts in the δ109Ag value caused by cations can be corrected to less than 0.02‰. There are considerable shifts down to −0.82‰ in δ109Ag from the accepted δ109Ag value when soluble metasilicate is present in the solution, which might explain the discrepancies in measured δ109Ag values for silicate materials. To accurately analyze silver isotopic compositions, especially of silicates with extremely low silver abundance, a silver standard doping method with an optimum doping proportion (sample-to-standard material ratio of 2:8) has been shown to produce an acceptable measurement uncertainty from 0.04 to 0.06‰ (2SD). The high-precision δ109Ag value determined in this study for ultramafic rocks from Balmuccia and the basalt reference material, BHVO-2, of −0.044 ± 0.062‰ is consistent with that of −0.16 ± 0.07‰ reported by previous studies.

Here, we report high‐precision Zr isotopic compositions of thin‐sectioned and hand‐picked zircon crystals from monzodiorites and K‐feldspar granites, which represent the mafic and felsic products of a differentiating magma. Our results reveal that zircons from both rock associations are dominated by a rim‐ward increase in the 94 Zr/ 90 Zr ratio and accompanied by ∼1‰ intracrystalline and intercrystalline variations, confirming the preferential incorporation of light Zr isotopes and thus kinetic isotopic fractionation during zircon growth. Notably, zircons enclosed by K‐feldspar in monzodiorites generally yield lower 94 Zr/ 90 Zr and higher Zr/Hf ratios than that of separated crystals, while in K‐feldspar granites, tiny zircons intergrown with apatite obtain higher 94 Zr/ 90 Zr but lower Zr/Hf ratios relative to that of sizable separates.

Depending on magma types or conditions of phase equilibria, formation of these Ti‐rich minerals can result in Ti isotopic fractionation in the range of ‐1.52‰ to +2.90‰ on δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti (i.e., the per mil difference of 49 Ti/ 47 Ti ratio relative to the OL‐Ti reference material), making the Ti isotope ratios of these minerals potential tracers for conditions of magmatism and metamorphism. Due to their resistance to aqueous alteration, these Ti‐rich accessory minerals are also commonly present as pristine, detrital phases in sedimentary rocks, which offer an opportunity to study the evolution of magmatism and metamorphism throughout the Earth's geological history. Here we have developed a novel technique for in situ Ti isotopic measurement in ilmenite, titanite and perovskite using femtosecond laser ablation multi‐collector inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry (fs‐LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS) under wet plasma conditions. Samples were ablated with different laser spot sizes (15–50 μm) and different laser energy densities (0.6–4.2 J cm ‐2 ) to obtain adequate Ti signal intensity at a fixed laser repetition rate of 2 Hz. When 49 Ti signal intensity of samples ranged from 0.3 to 3.7 V, no significant signal‐dependent Ti isotopic fractionation was observed under wet plasma conditions. Repeated measurements on twelve Ti‐rich minerals using different analytical protocols provided comparable δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti values within uncertainties, confirming the accuracy of the proposed fs‐LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS method. With one exception (i.e., RUS1), all analysed minerals are homogeneous in their Ti isotopic compositions between individual chips with an intermediate precision of ±0.13‰ to ±0.17‰ (2 s ) on δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti . Collectively, these minerals record a significant δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti variation ranging from ‐0.46‰ to +2.12‰.

The composition of chloritoid is extremely variable throughout the Massa Unit. Fe‐chloritoid occurs in association with hematite‐free, graphite‐bearing schists, whereas strongly zoned Fe‐Mg chloritoid is found with hematite and kyanite. We investigated the effect of different bulk Fe 2 O 3 contents in controlling chloritoid composition through phase equilibria modelling of four selected samples, representative of the different chloritoid‐bearing parageneses found in the Massa Unit. The ferric iron content, measured through wet chemical titration, ranges from 0 (graphite‐chloritoid schist) to 73% of the total iron (hematite‐chloritoid schist). We show that Mg‐rich chloritoid compositions and stability of kyanite at greenschist to blueschist facies conditions can be reproduced in the MnO–Na 2 O–K 2 O–FeO–MgO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 –H 2 O–TiO 2 –O (MnNKFMASHTO) chemical system only considering the presence of significant amounts of ferric iron as part of the bulk composition. The stabilization of kyanite at lower grade is directly linked to the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which renders the reactive bulk rock composition effectively enriched in Al 2 O 3 with respect to Fe and Mg. We also document that high Fe 2 O 3 contents exacerbate the effect of chloritoid fractionation, producing strongly zoned Fe‐Mg‐chloritoid grains. Finally, the P–T modelling of the Massa Units performed in this study allows, for the first time, the recognition of a two‐stage evolution at peak conditions, with an earlier pressure peak (1.2–1.3 GPa at 350–400°C), and a later thermal peak (0.7–1.1 GPa at 440–480°C), compatible with subduction, underthrusting and exhumation of the Adria continental margin during growth of the Northern Apennine orogenic wedge.", "authors": ["Samuele Papeschi", "Federico Rossetti", "Jesse B.

Most U–Pb zircon geochronological and metamorphic studies have focused on rocks from the central region of the mainland LGC, where granulite facies assemblages associated with the oldest (Badcallian) tectono‐metamorphic event at c. 2.75 Ga are overprinted by younger amphibolite facies assemblages related to the Inverian (c. 2.5 Ga) and subsequent Laxfordian (c. 1.9–1.65 Ga) tectono‐thermal events. In the southern and northern regions of the mainland LGC, deformation and metamorphism associated with the Laxfordian event are pervasive, although the timing and conditions are poorly constrained. Here, we present new field, petrographic and structural data, U–Pb zircon and titanite geochronology and phase equilibrium modelling of amphibolite samples from the northern and southern regions. Our field observations show that in both regions, pre‐Laxfordian structures are significantly reworked by steep NW‐striking fabrics that are themselves pervasively overprinted by co‐axial deformation and amphibolite facies metamorphism related to the Laxfordian event. In situ U–Pb titanite geochronology yields Laxfordian ages of 1853 ± 20 Ma in the southern region (P = 6–8 kbar and T = 640–690°C) and 1750 ± 20 Ma and 1776 ± 10 Ma in the northern region (P = 6–7.5 kbar and T = 740–760°C). While U–Pb dating of zircon rims from felsic gneisses in the central region shows a dominant Inverian metamorphic overprint at c. 2500 Ma, zircon rims in felsic gneisses from the northern and southern regions commonly yield Laxfordian dates as young as c. 1800 Ma. Combined, the results support the idea that, during the Palaeoproterozoic, the central region of the LGC acted as low‐strain domain, in which intense deformation and metamorphism were restricted to crustal‐scale shear zones. By contrast, in the southern and northern regions, early (c. 1.85 Ga) and late (c. 1.75 Ga) Laxfordian deformation and fluid‐mediated metamorphism were much more pervasive and at higher P–T conditions than previously proposed. The diachronous Laxfordian evolution of the southern and northern regions indicate that they reflect early and late snapshots of collisional to transpressional tectonics in the mainland LGC. The long‐lasting Laxfordian evolution documents the collision of the Rae and North Atlantic cratons during the Palaeoproterozoic amalgamation of the supercontinent Nuna, with implications for the palaeogeographic configuration of NW Scotland during Palaeoproterozoic Nuna.", "authors": ["Silvia Volante", "Annika Dziggel", "Jesse B.

A magmatic-hydrothermal origin or mantle-derived fluid source has been proposed for the giant gold deposits of the Jiaodong District in the eastern North China craton, but direct evidence is sparse, and the mineralization processes remain controversial. Here, we present the results of a comprehensive geological, geochronological, and geochemical study of the gold mineralized Xiejia diorite beneath the Linglong ore field at Jiaodong to link the gold mineralization to underlying magmatism. Magmatic zircon and titanite grains from the Xiejia diorite have laser ablation−inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb ages of 121.3 ± 0.9 Ma to 120.8 ± 1.1 Ma and 121.7 ± 3.9 Ma, respectively, which are indistinguishable from the time of gold deposition throughout the Jiaodong District as constrained by previous studies. The diorite has a shoshonitic composition and is characterized by strong enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) along with significant depletion in high field strength elements (HFSEs) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs). Samples of the diorite have high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, but low εNd(t) and ɛHf(t) values and low Pb isotope ratios. These geochemical characteristics are akin to those of contemporaneous mafic dikes in most gold mines at Jiaodong, indicating that the Xiejia diorite was most likely derived from an enriched lithospheric mantle source. The upper part of the diorite intrusion is pervasively altered and mineralized, containing an average of 0.32 g/t Au, but locally up to 7.59 g/t. Hydrothermal titanite from the mineralized diorite has a LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age of 122.3 ± 4.3 Ma, which is consistent with the gold-bearing pyrite Re-Os isochron age of 122.5 ± 6.7 Ma. Ore-related sericite aggregates from the Dongfeng gold deposit above the Xiejia diorite have a 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 122.6 ± 1.3 Ma. Pyrite from the mineralized diorite yielded δ34SCDT values of 2.1‰−9.7‰, which are comparable with those of pyrite (δ34SCDT = 5.8‰−8.1‰, where CDT indicates the Canyon Diablo troilite standard) from gold ores of Dongfeng. Pyrite grains from both groups also have similar Pb isotope compositions. The S and Pb isotope data are consistent with values of mafic dikes that are spatially and temporally associated with gold veins in the Linglong ore field. The results presented here thus indicate a possible genetic link between gold mineralization in the Xiejia diorite and underlying magma presumably represented by the Xiejia diorite. The auriferous fluids exsolved from that magma and migrated upward along the Potouqing fault to form the Dongfeng gold deposit above the Xiejia diorite.

Here we use in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis of sulfur-in-apatite to monitor changes in the oxidation state of sulfur during high-P metasomatism by slab fluids in the subduction channel. Our samples include a 73 cm continuous transect of reaction zones between a metagabbroic eclogite block and serpentinite matrix from a m&amp;#233;lange zone on the island of Syros, Greece. The block core consists of garnet, omphacite, phengite, paragonite, epidote-clinozoisite, and rutile. In this region, apatite is only observed as elongate inclusions in omphacite cores. From the core outwards micas are increasingly replaced by epidote-clinozoisite, garnets are smaller and more frequent, pyrite + bornite is observed as inclusions in recrystallized omphacite, and apatite is increasingly abundant in the matrix and inclusions in garnet. A major transition at 48 cm separates an assemblage of Ca-Na amphibole, omphacite, chlorite, pyrite, and apatite from the inner garnet-bearing eclogite assemblages. Omphacite disappears from the assemblage at ~56 cm and amphibole compositions sharply transition to tremolite at 59 cm. Finally, the assemblage tremolite + talc + pyrite is observed after ~70 cm.Apatites in the eclogite assemblages exclusively display S6+ peaks in their absorption spectra. This includes apatite inclusions in omphacite in the least altered lithology, as well as matrix apatite and isolated apatite inclusions in garnet in the outermost metasomatized eclogite zone. In the intermediate pyrite-rich (~1&amp;#8211;5 vol %) amphibole + omphacite + chlorite zone, apatite displays a strong S1- absorption peak in most grains, with rare analyses showing mixed S1- and S6+. Finally, apatite in the outermost tremolite-bearing assemblages only displays a S6+ peak. The pyrite-rich zone at 48 cm occurs at the initial interface between the serpentinite matrix and eclogite block, characterized by a dramatic decrease in Na content and Mg#. Our data suggest that reduction of S6+ in infiltrating fluids to S1- in pyrite became focused as Fe diffused across the steep Mg# gradient, resulting in pyrite precipitation. In contrast, S reduction in the Mg-rich tremolite-dominant portions of the transect was limited by a lack of Fe, resulting in low modes of pyrite and fluid buffered S6+ in apatite. Finally, S6+-bearing apatite is also observed in reaction zone lithologies from elsewhere on Syros, suggesting our observations are not isolated.Two important conclusions are drawn from these data and observations: (1) In the case of Syros, slab fluids at eclogite-facies conditions carried oxidized S6+, and (2) The interaction of these fluids with eclogites composed of ferrous-Fe silicates resulted in extensive sulfide precipitation.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

However, it remains unclear how this process influences magma chemistry. Here we use a compilation of geochemical data, well‐established geochemical proxies (i.e., Ba/Nb, Th/Nb) and mantle redox modeling (i.e., V/Sc, Cu) to propose that the subduction of a ridge underneath the central portion of the Vanuatu arc causes shallow‐angle subduction and the development of a slab tear. We suggest that the shallow slab pinches out the asthenospheric mantle and bulldozes ancient metasomatized lithospheric mantle from the forearc toward the main‐arc. Slab‐fluxed melting of this bulldozed material could account for the along‐arc 87 Sr/ 86 Sr‐ 143 Nd/ 144 Nd variations of the Vanuatu magmas. The influx of hot sub‐slab material into the Vanuatu arc mantle wedge through a slab tear produces magmatism within the forearc. Modeling of V/Sc and Cu systematics suggest that the mantle source of the forearc magmas has a higher f O 2 and Cu content than the source of the main‐arc and rear‐arc samples. The main‐arc and rear‐arc mantles were metasomatized by both slab‐derived fluids and melts. Whereas release of high Cu‐SO 2 slab‐derived fluids caused oxidation and Cu enrichment of the forearc mantle. These systematics indicate a decrease in the f O 2 of slab fluxes with increasing depth‐to‐slab and distance‐from‐trench. Our findings highlight the role of ridge subduction in controlling the along‐arc and across‐arc variations in the chemistry of Vanuatu arc magmas.

The Wuwamen accretionary complex in the Chinese South Tianshan contains a tectonic mélange that witnessed the dynamic evolution from early accretion to final collision of the western CAOB with the Tarim Craton. We present geochronological and geochemical studies on the exotic blocks and metasedimentary matrix of the tectonic mélange in order to refine the subduction‐accretion processes in the CAOB. Geochemical and age data reveal that the exotic blocks are of diverse origins, including arc‐related granite and arc basalt‐like garnet amphibolite from the upper plate, and MORB‐like amphibolite from the subducting slab. The blocks underwent subduction‐related high‐temperature metamorphism between ca. 397 and 340 Ma. Detrital zircons in the metasedimentary matrix are dominated by Paleozoic ages corresponding to the continuous arc magmatism in the Yili‐Central Tianshan Block. This finding is consistent with the accretion of the Wuwamen complex on the southern margin of the Yili‐Central Tianshan Block above the northward subducting South Tianshan Ocean. A ca. 307 Ma post‐accretion granite dyke intruded the Wuwamen complex, thereby providing a minimum age limit for its terminal accretion. In conjunction with subduction‐related magmatism, metamorphism, and sedimentation, the accretion of the Wuwamen accretionary complex was active during the early Ordovician to the late Carboniferous.

The thermodynamic techniques underlying these inferences assume a uniform, constant pressure. Nonetheless, convergent margins generate significant non‐hydrostatic (unequal) stresses, violating the uniform pressure assumption and creating uncertainty. Materials scientists F. Larché and J. Cahn derived an equation suitable for non‐hydrostatically stressed geologic environments that links stress and equilibrium composition in elastic, multi‐component crystals. However, previous works have shown that for binary solid solutions with ideal mixing behavior, hundreds of MPa to GPa‐level stresses are required to shift mineral compositions by a few hundredths of a mole fraction, limiting the equation's applicability. Here, we apply Larché and Cahn's equation to garnet, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase solid solutions, incorporating for the first time non‐ideal mixing behavior and more than two endmembers. We show that non‐ideal mixing increases predicted stress‐induced composition changes by up to an order of magnitude. Further, incorporating additional solid solution endmembers changes the predicted stress‐induced composition shifts of the other endmembers being considered. Finally, we demonstrate that Larché and Cahn's approach yields positive entropy production, a requirement for any real process to occur. Our findings reveal that stresses between tens and a few hundred MPa can shift mineral compositions by several hundredths of a mole fraction. Consequently, mineral compositions could plausibly be used to infer stress states. We suggest that stress‐composition effects could develop via intracrystalline diffusion in any high‐grade metamorphic setting, but are most likely in hot, dry, and strong rocks such as lower crustal granulites.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hess", "Jay J.

Exsolved phases in garnet from high‐grade metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks may have COR, but the complexity of COR distributions has thus far restricted their use to identifying exsolved phases. Classification of COR also remains mineral‐specific, leaving doubt as to what information COR preserve. To test how COR may be standardized, we calculated mismatch of low‐index crystallographic planes ( d‐value ratios) and crystallographic directions (rows of atoms) between precipitates and garnet and defined search criteria for structural alignments likely to be energetically favourable. We analysed published electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data for apatite, rutile, ilmenite, corundum, and quartz precipitates in garnet ( n tot = 1,296) for the presence of these alignments. Our method predicts between 88% and 98% of observed alignments across the studied minerals and requires only calculations using unit cell parameters. We further show that each exsolved mineral forms COR predicted by the edge‐to‐edge matching model which was developed to describe unambiguous exsolution textures in alloys. Edge‐to‐edge matching aligns atoms at the host–precipitate interface by parallelism or near‐parallelism of crystallographic planes of similar spacing and parallelism of crystallographic directions (rows of atoms) of similar length on the edges of those planes. Edge‐to‐edge matches likely facilitate coherent to semi‐coherent interfaces by lowering surface free energy and strain energy, stabilizing precipitates. These matches are defined by criteria applicable to all minerals, making them an ideal tool for classifying, discovering and interpreting COR of diverse precipitates in garnet. This approach may also predict COR in other geological mineral pairs (e.g., exsolved feldspars). We find that edge‐to‐edge matching may explain the stability of the needle‐shaped morphologies commonly observed for exsolution textures in garnet. Edge‐to‐edge matching COR distributions can be tested as proxies of the state of the host rock at the time of exsolution to evaluate factors such as temperature, cooling rate, degree of undercooling, and/or strain. Patterns of edge‐to‐edge matching COR may be paired with geothermobarometry and/or petrochronology to provide a powerful new tool for studying the histories of granulite and eclogite facies metamorphic and igneous rocks.", "authors": ["Duncan S.

However, mercury (Hg) can be used to fingerprint catastrophic volcanism in the sedimentary record. We examined two sections that record the CPE at Laishike and Wayao in Guizhou Province, southwest China, which display high Hg contents along with spikes of Hg/total organic content (TOC), Hg/Al, Hg/total sulfur (TS), and Hg/(Mo/Al) during the CPE that indicate a shift to excess Hg loading. These Hg anomalies are correlative with the global negative excursion in δ13Ccarb values at the CPE, which suggests that increased volcanism injected both massive amounts of Hg and isotopically light carbon into the atmosphere, and these were ultimately recorded in marine sediments. This interpretation is supported by slightly negative or near-zero Δ199Hg values that are consistent with a volcanic Hg source. Our study supports the hypothesis that enhanced volcanism played a major role in the evolution of biota and the environment during the CPE.", "authors": ["He Zhao", "Stephen E.

A long-standing question, however, is whether the metal fertility of these systems stems from distinct sources that are anomalously enriched in Au or from subsequent processes occurring during crustal magma emplacement and hydrothermal activity. The Deseado Massif auriferous province in southern Patagonia (Argentina) is a unique place to test these contrasting hypotheses because Au-bearing mantle xenoliths indicate the presence of an underlying Au-rich lithospheric mantle reservoir. However, direct geochemical links between the Au-rich mantle source and the formation of the Deseado Massif auriferous province in the overlying crust remain to be established. To address this prominent gap in knowledge, we used sulfide Re-Os geochronology to identify the source of Au at Cerro Vanguardia, the largest low-sulfidation epithermal Au-Ag deposit in the Deseado Massif. Pyrite from high-grade Au quartz veins yielded an isochron age of 147.4 ± 2.9 Ma (mean square of weighted deviates = 1.04, n = 8) and an initial 187Os/188Os ratio of 0.26 ± 0.01, fingerprinting a dominant mantle control for the source of Os and, by inference, the source of Au. Our data provide a unique geochemical linkage between an Au-rich subcontinental lithospheric mantle source and the genesis of epithermal Au deposits, supporting the hypothesis that pre-enriched mantle domains may be a critical factor underpinning the global-scale localization of Au provinces.", "authors": ["Santiago Tassara", "Alan D.

Pathways that are involved in crosstalk can regulate each other and co-regulate downstream biological processes. Furthermore, some genes in the pathways can function with other genes via the relationship of the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism, which has also been demonstrated to play key roles in cellular biology. However, the comprehensive analysis of ceRNA-mediated pathway crosstalk is lacking. Here, we constructed the landscape of the ceRNA-mediated pathway–pathway crosstalk of eight major cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) based on sequencing data from ∼2,800 samples. Some common features shared by numerous CVDs were uncovered. A fraction of the pathway–pathway crosstalk was conserved in multiple CVDs and a core pathway–pathway crosstalk network was identified, suggesting the similarity of pathway–pathway crosstalk among CVDs. Experimental evidence also demonstrated that the pathway crosstalk was functioned in CVDs. We split all hub pathways of each pathway–pathway crosstalk network into three categories, namely, common hubs, differential hubs, and specific hubs, which could highlight the common or specific biological mechanisms. Importantly, after a comparison analysis of the hub pathways of networks, ∼480 hub pathway-induced common modules were identified to exert functions in CVDs broadly. Moreover, we performed a random walk algorithm on the hub pathway-induced sub-network and identified 23 potentially novel CVD-related pathways.

In this paper, we construct an LWIR hyperspectral system of a Fourier transform spectrometer composed of a HgCdTe photovoltaic IR FPA and a Michelson interferometer.

The effect of overshoot and ringing artifacts on the objective signals is reduced by the WAKF.

The effectiveness is also verified by comparing the spectra of denoised interferograms with the reference spectrum. The experimental results show that the WAKF algorithm has excellent noise suppression, and the standard deviation of the interferogram can be reduced by 39.50% compared with that of KF.

"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The origins of Eoarchean peridotites found in the Itsaq Gneiss Complex (IGG) of southern West Greenland represent a crucial record of igneous and geodynamic processes on the early Earth. The igneous and geodynamic origins of these rocks have, however, been the subject of controversy, with some researchers arguing that they represent the first known slivers of mantle emplaced by tectonic processes in the crust and others contending that they represent cumulates associated with the local basalt units. The geodynamic context for the formation of these rocks has also been disputed, with some researchers arguing that they formed in a horizontal tectonic setting analogous to a modern subduction zone, while others propose a vertical tectonic origin for all Eoarchean rocks. Here, we provide new insights into the history of these peridotites using multiple sulfur isotope signatures combined with Hf isotope compositions. Anomalously high &amp;amp;#949;&amp;amp;#919;f values in some IGC peridotites identified in previous studies [1], as well as in metabasalts with boninite-like compositions [2] found in the Isua Supracrustal Belt (ISB) within the IGC, point to contributions from a mantle source already depleted in the Hadean [2]. The multiple sulfur isotope data of the IGC peridotites found south of the ISB reveal small but significant &amp;amp;#916;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;33&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S anomalies, consistent with incorporation of surface-derived material of Archean age or older. Furthermore, correlations between sulfur isotope data and major and trace element abundances as well as initial Hf isotope values of IGC peridotites support the hypothesis that high-degree melt depletion occurred under hydrous conditions, followed by variable degrees of melt metasomatism. The involved fluid and melt components precipitated sulfides that incorporated surface-derived sulfur with different depositional origins. We propose that these findings are best explained by a horizontal tectonic regime similar to modern arc settings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1. van de L&amp;amp;#246;cht, J., et al., &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Preservation of Eoarchean mantle processes in &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8764;3.8&amp;amp;#8239;Ga peridotite enclaves in the Itsaq Gneiss Complex, southern West Greenland.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 2020. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;280&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: p. 1-25.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2.

Sediment compaction and dehydration of variably altered oceanic lithosphere during subduction release volatile species (containing e.g., S, H, C, N) to the overlying mantle wedge. In particular, sulfur plays a key role in the formation of porphyry ore deposits and has a major control on redox processes in subduction zones, given it occurs in variable oxidation states from oxidized sulfate (S&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;6+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) to reduced sulfide (S&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;). Here we studied samples from a contact between serpentinite and partly metasomatized eclogitic metagabbros in the Voltri Massif (Italy). We determined the bulk rock and in situ sulfur isotope composition of pyrite grains and combined this with detailed mineralogic and petrologic investigations. Along the serpentinite-metagabbro contact, the metagabbros are metasomatized to actinolite-chlorite schists and metagabbros rich in epidote and Na- and Na-Ca amphiboles. The serpentinites as well as the actinolite-chlorite schists along the serpentinite-metagabbro contact have very low sulfide contents and provide evidence for the oxidation of sulfides, including formation of Fe-oxides. Sulfur input from the serpentinite-metagabbro contact towards the less metasomatized eclogitic metagabbros is observed. This sulfur input is reflected by bulk rock &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values that increase from initially around +1.5&amp;amp;#8240; in samples distant from the contact to +7.3 to +12.5&amp;amp;#8240; in samples near the contact. This trend correlates with a general increase in the in situ &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values from core to rim of individual pyrite grains. Distinct Co and Ni growth zones in pyrite and variations in the in situ &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values indicate multiple phases of pyrite growth during subduction and exhumation of these rocks, with the last stage of pyrite growth clearly related to Mg-metasomatism along the serpentinite-metagabbro contact.

During the dehydration of serpentinites in subduction zones volatile phases like sulfur can be leached out or further transported into the mantle. For understanding the fate of sulfur in subduction zones, it is crucial to identify the signature of sulfides during the process of hydration. The reduction of seawater sulfate takes place under isotopic fractionation of sulfur. Generally, positive &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values are a result of high temperature thermochemical reduction of SO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; to H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;S while negative &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S are a result of microbial sulfate reduction under low temperatures. High temperature fluids are typically derived from interaction with gabbroic intrusions before they alter the ultramafic host rocks. In contrast, low temperature fluids can be derived from relatively unmodified seawater. Therefore, these fluids imprint different metal concentrations during concurrent sulfide precipitation. Here we study ODP (Ocean Drilling Program) samples from the Iberian Margin and 15&amp;amp;#176;20'N Fracture Zone along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge together with samples of ophiolitic serpentinites from the Northern Apennines.

High temperature fluids precipitate sulfides with stronger enrichments in metals like Cu, Co and Ni compared to sulfides formed from low temperature fluids. In respect to mafic dominated systems, sulfides from high temperature fluids of ultramafic systems show distinct enrichments in Ni. As a consequence, the combination of variations in &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S and trace element signatures can be used to trace back the tectonic environment in which the sulfides formed and maybe used as a tracer for sulfide formation in subduction zones.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;", "authors": ["Malte Kalter", "Esther M.

Because magmas in continental arcs undergo copper depletion during their early differentiation, a widely held hypothesis posits that the removed copper is locked at the base of the crust in copper-rich cumulates that form due to early sulfide saturation. Testing this hypothesis requires direct evidence for such copper-rich reservoirs and a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving sulfide saturation. Interaction between oxidized magmas and reducing crustal material in island arcs has been shown to be an efficient process causing sulfide saturation. However, the extent to which crustal assimilation impacts the flux of chalcophile elements during magmatism in thick continental arcs remains to be established. Here, we provide a deep perspective into these problems by studying a suite of subarc cumulate rocks from the Acadian orogen, New England (USA). These cumulates record the imprint of subduction zone magmatism and represent the residues left behind during the genesis of intermediate to evolved Acadian magmas (ca. 410 Ma). We find that the most primitive Acadian cumulates are enriched in copper (up to ~730 µg g–1) hosted by sulfide phases, providing direct evidence for the formation of lower crustal copper-rich reservoirs. The Acadian cumulates reveal a wide range of δ34S values, from –4.9‰ in the ultramafic rocks to 8‰ in the most evolved mafic rocks. The negative δ34S values observed in the most primitive and copper-rich cumulates (avg –3‰) reflect the assimilation of isotopically light sulfur from surrounding sulfidic and graphite-bearing metasedimentary rocks (δ34S of –19 to –12‰), whereas the more evolved cumulates with positive δ34S signatures may have formed from different magma batches that experienced less sediment assimilation. The assimilation of these reducing metasedimentary rocks caused a critical drop in oxygen fugacity (~DFMQ –2.5 to –1.9; FMQ = fayalite-quartz-magnetite buffer) in the evolving magmas, ultimately leading to extensive sulfide saturation and the consequent formation of copper-rich subarc cumulates. Assimilation-driven sulfide saturation may be a common process at the root of thickened arc crusts that triggers the formation of lower crustal copper-rich reservoirs, which play a pivotal role in the fate of copper during arc magmatism. Thus, deeply buried reducing metasedimentary crustal material at the base of continental arcs can act as a barrier to the magmatic flux of chalcophile elements and may play a crucial role in the genesis and distribution of porphyry copper deposits.", "authors": ["Santiago Tassara", "Jay J.

The mass fractionation caused by instrumental mass discrimination was corrected by a combination of internal correction using Sr as an internal standard (coming from a NIST SRM 987 standard solution) and external correction using a matrix-matched standard. Several important instrument parameters were investigated, such as the effect of the addition of N 2 and “wet” plasma condition, the mass fractionation behaviors between Zr isotopes and Sr isotopes, the position effect in laser ablation cell and the effect of laser ablation parameters (laser spot size and energy density). The Zr isotope compositions of seven zircons (GJ-1, 91500, Plešovice, Rak-17, Paki, Aus and Mala) were determined by the developed fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). Our fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS results for Zr isotope compositions agreed with TIMS analyses within analytical uncertainties, indicating the presented method is a suitable tool to resolve isotopic zoning in natural zircons.

This study describes a rapid bulk rock digestion method (NH 4 F digestion) for determination of the abundances of Cl, Br and I in geological materials by SF‐ICP‐MS. During high temperature (200–240 °C) digestion, NH 3 released from the decomposition of molten NH 4 F can effectively prevent the loss of halogens released from geological samples.

Titanite may also incorporate significant inherited Pb, which may lead to inaccurate and geologically ambiguous U–Pb dates if a proper correction is not or cannot be applied. Here, we present laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA‐ICP‐MS)‐derived titanite U–Pb dates and trace element concentrations for two banded calcsilicate gneisses from south‐central Maine, USA (SSP18‐1A and SSP18‐1B). Single spot common Pb‐corrected dates range from 400 to 280 Ma with ±12–20 Ma propagated 2SE. Titanite grains in sample SSP18‐1B exhibit regular core‐to‐rim variations in texture, composition, and date. We identify four titanite populations: (1) 397 ± 5 Ma (95% CL) low Y + HREE cores and mottled grains, (2) 370 ± 7 Ma high Y + REE mantles and cores, (3) 342 ± 6 Ma cores with high Y + REE and no Eu anomaly, and (4) 295 ± 6 Ma LREE‐depleted rims. We interpret the increase in titanite Y + HREE between ca. 397 and ca. 370 Ma to constrain the timing of diopside fracturing and recrystallization and amphibole breakdown. Apparent Zr‐in‐titanite temperatures (803 ± 36°C at 0.5 ± 0.2 GPa) and increased X Di suggest a thermal maximum at ca. 370 Ma. Population 3 domains dated to ca. 342 Ma exhibit no Eu anomaly and are observed only in compositional bands dominated by diopside (&gt;80 vol%), suggesting limited equilibrium between titanite and plagioclase. Finally, low LREE and high U/Th in Population 4 titanite dates the formation of hydrous phases, such as allanite, during high X H2O fluid infiltration at ca. 295 Ma. In contrast to the well‐defined date–composition–texture relationships observed for titanite from SSP18‐1B, titanite grains from sample SSP18‐1A exhibit complex zoning patterns and little correlation between texture, composition, and date. We hypothesize that the incorporation of variable amounts of radiogenic Pb from dissolved titanite into recrystallized domains resulted in mixed dates spanning 380–330 Ma. Although titanite may reliably record multiple phases of metamorphism, these data highlight the importance of considering U–Pb data along with chemical and textural data to screen for inherited radiogenic Pb.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

Despite the ubiquity of carbonates in the slab, little is known of the physicochemical behavior of siderite and rhodochrosite at high-pressure (P) and high-temperature (T) conditions during slab subduction. In this study, we characterized the Raman vibrational spectra of natural siderite and rhodochrosite up to 47 GPa and 1100 K in an externally heated diamond-anvil cell (DAC). Experimental results show that the Raman frequency shifts (νi) for siderite and rhodochrosite are a function of both P and T, and the effect of the P-T cross derivative term cannot be neglected, especially at high-P and high-T conditions. Based on the functional relationship of νi-P-T, the P-T calibrants of siderite and rhodochrosite are developed, respectively. This is significant for studying the water-carbonate interaction at high P-T conditions in a DAC because the undesired change of the experimental system from traditional pressure sensors (e.g., ruby, quartz) in a reaction chamber can be avoided. Like previous studies, we observed a sharp spin transition at ~45 GPa in siderite and a phase transition from MnCO3-I to MnCO3-II at ~46 GPa for rhodochrosite at room temperature. Furthermore, we determined the isobaric and isothermal equivalents of the mode Grüneisen parameter (γiT, γiP) and the anharmonic parameter (ai) for each Raman mode of siderite and rhodochrosite. The δνi/δP, δνi/δT, γiT, γiP, and ai span a much larger value range for the external lattice modes (T, L) than internal modes (ν4, ν1) in both siderite and rhodochrosite. Combining Raman frequency shifts and the first-order Murnaghan equation of state, we also developed a method to calculate the temperature dependence of the bulk modulus (KT) for siderite and rhodochrosite, respectively.", "authors": ["Chao Wang", "Lu’an Ren", "Jesse B.

绿松石（CuAl6（PO4）4（OH）8·4（H2O））是重要的表生宝石矿物，已有研究采用绿松石主量元素Cu的同位素进行产地溯源，但是溯源机理不明确.此外，绿松石生长过程复杂，该过程是否造成Cu同位素组成的显著变化还不甚清楚，这限制了其产地溯源的应用.湖北省竹山县是全球最大的宝石级绿松石产出地，采用MC-ICP-MS对竹山县条带状绿松石的生长条带进行高精度Cu同位素测试.结果表明：绿松石δ65Cu值较高，然而不同条带没有明显变化（δ65Cu=10.99‰~11.54‰）.绿松石含矿热液沉淀过程分馏有限（< 1‰），这指示绿松石Cu同位素显著变化主要发生在含矿热液的形成过程.原生硫化物的δ65Cu=0±1‰，显著低于绿松石样品测定值，推测引起含矿热液Cu同位素显著分馏的主要原因是原生硫化物发生氧化作用.全球典型绿松石矿区的数据整体与该结果一致，表明绿松石Cu同位素组成主要受源区环境的控制；同一矿区中形成的绿松石，即使经历周期生长产生条带状结构，其Cu同位素组成基本一致.该研究深入探究了Cu同位素示踪绿松石矿区的机理，同时也加深了对低温过程Cu同位素分馏的认识.

Sulu orogenic belt is world-known as an ultra-high pressure (UHP) terrane formed by continental subduction and collision.Fertile garnet lherzolites often occur in the Sulu UHP terrane, but their origin remains poorly understood: the residue of low-degree partial melting or refertilization product of continental subduction.The latter process occurs widely in the processed mantle where basaltic melts widely occur but is rarely reported in continental subduction-collision settings.Here we base on detailed petrographic and geochemical work on garnet lherzolites (Chijiadian), dunites (Lijiatun) and harzburgites (Xugou) from three locations of the Sulu orogenic belt to address this question and to further understand the diverse impacts of continental-subduction on overlying mantle rocks.Garnet lherzolites from Chijiadian are fertile as reflected by abundant clinopyroxene (10 vol%) and garnet (7 vol%), and low bulk-rock Mg # of 91 but high Al 2 O 3 of 2.39 to 3.31wt.%.Garnet, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene include early-stage phases such as olivine and spinel, mainly occur in grain boundary and display secondary poikilitic textures.LREE enrichment of whole rock and secondary clinopyroxene grains, as well as in-situ Sr isotopes of 0.7062-0.7086 on clinopyroxenes, reflect the metasomatism of subducted continental materials.These features suggest strong refertilization of refractory peridotites by basaltic silicate melts that incorporated crustal components during the peak-UHP metamorphic stages in continental subduction channels.Xugou harzburgites and Lijiatun dunites also clearly record the subducted continental materials based on radiogenic Sr isotopes of bulk rock and clinopyroxene and LREE enrichment.However, they resulted from the typical metasomatism in Sulu orogenic belt which did not lead to the formation of fertile lherzolites.Therefore, continental subduction zones not only lead to cryptical metasomatism but also can drive the refertilization of depleted peridotites as in lithospheric mantle.", "authors": ["Aiqing Ren", "Zaicong Wang", "Keqing Zong", "Wen Zhang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Zhaochu Hu"], "doi":

Here we summarize recent advances in quantifying this component of the deep sulfur cycle. First, primary metamorphic or inherited sulfides in oceanic-type eclogites are only rarely observed as inclusions and are typically absent from the rock matrix. Additionally, sulfides are relatively common in rocks metasomatized at the slab-mantle interface by slab-derived fluids during exhumation. Combined, these two observations suggest that sulfur loss from subducted mafic crust is relatively efficient. Thermodynamic modeling in Perple_X using the Holland and Powell (2011) database combined with the Deep Earth Water model suggests that the efficiency and speciation of sulfur loss varies depending on the degree of seafloor alteration prior to subduction and the geothermal gradient of the slab. In relatively cold subduction zones, such as Honshu, slab-fluids derived from subducted mafic crust are predicted to exhibit elevated concentrations of HSO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, SO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, HSO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, and CaSO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4(aq)&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, whereas hot subduction zones, such as Cascadia, are predicted to produce slab fluids enriched in HS&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; and H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;S at lower pressures. The oxidation of sulfur expelled from subducted pyrite is balanced by the reduction of Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, consistent with the low Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/SFe of exhumed eclogites relative to blueschists and altered oceanic crust. Where oxidized S-bearing fluids are produced, they are anticipated to interact with more reduced rocks at the slab-mantle interface and within the mantle wedge, resulting in sulfide precipitation and significant isotopic fractionation. The &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values of slab fluids are estimated to fall between -11 and +8 &amp;amp;#8240;. Rayleigh fractionation during progressive fluid-rock interaction results in fractionations of tens of per mil as oxidized species are depleted and sulfides are precipitated, resulting in &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values of sulfides that easily span the -21.7 to +13.9 &amp;amp;#8240; range observed in metasomatic sulfides in exhumed high-pressure rocks. However, in subduction zones where reduced species prevail, the S isotopic signature of slab fluids is expected to reflect their source and will exhibit a narrower range in &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values. As a result, the &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values measured in arc magmas may not always be a reliable indicator of the contribution of different components of the slab, such as sediments vs. AOC. Additionally, the impact of S recycling on the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is expected to vary both spatially and temporally throughout Earth history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;", "authors": ["Jesse B.

We present a geochemical and petrological study of serpentinites and ophicalcites of the Northern Apennine ophiolite, Italy. This ophiolite sequence represents fragments of Jurassic oceanic lithosphere that have been denuded by low angle detachment faults, exposing peridotites on the ocean floor and triggering hydrothermal alteration. Seawater circulation is documented by (Jurassic) seawater‐like 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values and δ 13 C values of 1.1–3.0‰ in carbonate veins of the ophicalcites. Bulk rock ophicalcites have low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values of 0.70489–0.70599, elevated SiO 2 contents, and talc druses filling calcite veins that record Si‐metasomatism. In contrast, underlying serpentinites have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values above Jurassic seawater values. Bulk rock δD and δ 18 O values of ophicalcites and serpentinites suggest interaction with an evolved seawater‐derived and/or magmatic fluid. These chemical signatures result from a complex history of serpentinization, carbonation, and metasomatism. Multiphase water‐rock interaction includes infiltration of basement‐derived fluids during initial mantle upwelling within an opening ocean basin, followed by localized high‐temperature fluid infiltration, extensive seawater circulation resulting in carbonation, and oxidation near the seawater‐exposed surface, and finally, fluid‐rock interaction with overlying mafic lithologies leading to Si‐metasomatism. The studied sequence represents an excellent example of the evolution from serpentinite to ophicalcite during continuous uplift and exposure of ultramafic rocks on the seafloor and documents the complex hydrothermal evolution of ultramafic rocks associated with this process. The extensive chemical transformation of mantle peridotites likely has an impact on geochemical cycles and subduction zone processes.", "authors": ["Esther M.

Consequently, there is debate over the significance of non‐hydrostatic stress in petrological and geophysical processes. To help resolve this debate, we consider the effects of non‐hydrostatic stress on the polymorph pairs kyanite/sillimanite, graphite/diamond, calcite/aragonite, and quartz/coesite. While these polymorphs are most relevant to metamorphic processes, the concepts developed are applicable to any single‐component solid reaction. We quantitatively show how stress variations normal to an interface alter equilibrium temperatures of polymorph pairs by approximately two orders of magnitude more than stress variations parallel to an interface. Thus, normal stress controls polymorph stability to first order. High‐pressure polymorphs are expected to preferentially nucleate normal to and grow parallel to the maximum stress and low‐pressure polymorphs, the minimum stress. Nonetheless, stress variations parallel to an interface allow for the surprising possibility that a high‐pressure polymorph can become more stable relative to a low‐pressure polymorph as stress decreases. The effects of non‐hydrostatic stress on mineral equilibrium are unlikely to be observed in systems with interconnected, fluid‐filled porosity, as fluid‐mediated reactions yield mineral assemblages at approximately constant pressures. In dry systems, however, reactions can occur directly between elastic solids, facilitating the direct application of non‐hydrostatic thermodynamics. Non‐hydrostatic stress is likely to be important to the evolution of metamorphic systems, as preferential orientations of polymorphic reactions can generate seismicity and may influence fundamental rock properties such as porosity and seismic anisotropy.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hess", "Jay J.

Here we studied partially serpentinized peridotites from the Chimaera seeps (Turkey), an active continental serpentinization system that vents highly methane‐rich fluids, to investigate the impact of water‐rock interaction on the sulfide and metal mineralogy and its implications on supporting microbial communities. Using high‐resolution scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, and transmission electron microscopy we found diverse pentlandite decomposition features with precipitation of secondary sulfides including millerite, heazlewoodite, as well as Cu‐bearing sulfides, native Cu, and awaruite (Ni 3 Fe). Awaruite forms dense veinlets to single crystal platelets tens of nanometers in size, which is formed by desulphurization of pentlandite. In addition, the nanometer‐sized awaruite platelets are intimately intergrown with serpentine suggesting its growth during peridotite alteration by a dissolution‐precipitation process, likely associated with the interaction of methane‐ and H 2 ‐rich but highly sulfur‐undersaturated fluids. Based on sulfur isotope signatures we infer a mantle and mid‐ocean ridge origin of the sulfide minerals associated with the first stage of partial serpentinization and awaruite formation. Subsequent and ongoing continental fluid‐rock interaction causes significant sulfide decomposition resulting in the formation of porosity and the release of, amongst others, H 2 S and Fe.

In the present study, an early Paleozoic granitoid sequence from the Kontum massif in the central Indochina block was investigated to reveal the early Paleozoic accretionary orogenesis of the eastern Tethys. Early Paleozoic Kontum granitoids include diorites and granites. Early Ordovician (485–473 Ma) Ben Giang diorites show high Mg#, Cr and Ni contents, and negative Nb-Ta and positive Pb anomalies as well as positive zircon ɛHf(t) values (+6.2 to +10), probably reflecting the melting of a metasomatized mantle wedge. Late Ordovician (457–453 Ma) Dien Binh hornblende-bearing diorites and granites exhibit low Mg#, Cr and Ni contents, and negative Nb-Ta and positive Pb anomalies as well as negative zircon ɛHf(t) values (−8.7 to −4.2), which is interpreted to reflect the reworking of ancient continental mafic crust during subduction. In contrast, the Silurian (422 Ma) Dai Loc muscovite-bearing granites are characterized by relatively high A/CNK and heavy rare earth element contents, and a negative Eu anomaly, corresponding to a typical S-type granite affinity.

In this study, we present a 3-D anisotropic P-wave velocity model of the crust beneath northern California by using the eikonal equation-based seismic azimuthal anisotropy tomography method. The velocity heterogeneities under different geological units are well resolved. The thickness of the low-velocity sediment at the Great Valley Sequence is estimated to be about 10 km. The high-velocity anomaly underlying Great Valley probably indicates the existence of ophiolite bodies. Strong velocity contrasts are revealed across the Hayward Fault (2–9 km) and San Andreas Fault (2–12 km). In the upper crust (2–9 km), the fast velocity directions (FVDs) are generally fault-parallel in the northern Coast Range, which may be caused by geological structure; while the FVDs are mainly NE–SW in Great Valley and the northern Sierra Nevada possibly due to the regional maximum horizontal compressive stress. In contrast, seismic anisotropy in the mid-lower crust (12–22 km) may be attributed to the alignment of mica schists. The anisotropy contrast across the San Andreas Fault may imply different mechanisms of crustal deformation on the two sides of the fault. Both the strong velocity contrasts and the high angle (∼45° or above) between the FVDs and the strikes of faults suggest that the faults are mechanically weak in the San Francisco bay area (2–6 km).

{"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.32657/10356/155049", "title": "Eikonal equation-based seismic anisotropy tomography and its application to the imaging of the crust and uppermost mantle", "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy describes how the velocity of seismic wave varies with propagation direction in the Earth’s interior. Studying depth-dependent anisotropy variations is a way of estimating the crustal deformation and mantle flow patterns, which may help us better assess seismic hazards and understand ongoing tectonic dynamics. In this thesis, we develop a novel eikonal equation-based seismic anisotropy tomography method with multiple-grid model parametrization to construct 3D high-resolution anisotropic velocity model of the crust and upper mantle by inverting large amounts of P-wave first arrivals. The traveltime field and ray paths are accurately determined by numerically solving the Eikonal equation with the fast marching method. Multiple grids are utilized to parametrize the model space in the inversion. At each iteration, the output model is the average of the multiple models achieved from all the inversion grids. After that, I apply the method in some seismologically active and/or densely populated regions (northern California, southern Sumatra and Salton Trough) by inverting newly available datasets or public high-quality datasets. In the northern California, a 3D high-resolution P-wave anisotropic velocity model for the crust is developed. In the upper crust, the fault-parallel fast velocity directions (FVDs) generally prevail in the northern Coast Range due to the geological structure (e.g., fault-zone fabric and sedimentary bedding); while the Great Valley and the northern Sierra Nevada mainly show the NE-SW FVDs, possibly caused by the regional maximum horizontal compressive stress (SH_max). Contrarily, seismic anisotropy in the mid-lower crust may be attributed to the lattice-preferred orientations of mica schists. The San Francisco bay area (2-6 km) is characterize by both strong velocity contrasts and fault-oblique FVDs (~450 or above), suggesting that the faults there are mechanically weak. In the southern Sumatra, new P-wave anisotropic velocity models as well as the S-wave isotropic velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle are derived from a newly available dataset. All the tomographic results in the uppermost mantle reveal a clear high-velocity belt associated with the subducting Indo-Australian slab. The upper crust exhibits complex variations in the fast P-wave velocity direction associated with the SH_max and/or geological structure, while the orientated plastic flow possibly triggered by the oblique subduction contributes to the trench-normal FVDs in the lower crust. The anisotropy in the mantle wedge is closely related to the 2D corner flow or 3D complex mantle flow. Trench-parallel FVDs within the subducting slab may suggest the presence of the frozen-in anisotropy. In the Salton Trough, new crustal models of the P-wave azimuthally anisotropic velocity, S-wave isotropic velocity and Vp/Vs ratio are developed. High Vp and Vp/Vs ratio (> 1.8) in the lower crust of the Salton Trough possibly reflect the underplated gabbroic rocks as a result of the extension-induced partial melting of the upwelling asthenospheric materials. The FVDs in the study area generally correlate with the direction of the SH_max except along the main fault traces where fault-parallel FVDs are found. However, the FVDs in the Salton Trough show complex features possibly due to the compression, faulting, block rotation or thermal anomaly. In all, our velocity models suggest that the faults in southern Salton Trough basin may have a high risk of potential mechanical failures due to the complexities of stress distribution and geological structures as well as the presence of the large volume of fluids.

This allows for the application of classical equilibrium thermodynamics. In contrast, geodynamic modeling indicates that differential, or non-hydrostatic, stresses are widespread. Non-hydrostatic equilibrium thermodynamics have been developed by past workers [1], but their application to geological systems has generated controversy in recent years [2-5]. Therefore, we seek to clarify how stress influences the chemical potential of non-hydrostatically stressed elastic solids. To quantify this, we consider the effects of stress variation on the equilibrium between the single-component polymorph pairs of kyanite/sillimanite, quartz/coesite, calcite/aragonite, and diamond/graphite.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stress on each interface of a solid can be decomposed into components normal to the interface and parallel to the interface. In our work, we determine the shift in the temperature of equilibrium on fixed interfaces between polymorph pairs as a function of both interface-normal and interface-parallel stress variation. We find that the influence of normal stress variation on the equilibrium temperature of polymorphs is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than interface-parallel stress variation. Thus, at a fixed temperature, normal stress determines the chemical potential of a given interface to first order. Consequently, high-pressure polymorphs will preferentially form normal to the maximum stress, while low-pressure polymorphs, normal to the minimum stress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nonetheless, interface-parallel stress variations can meaningfully affect the stability of phases that are at or near equilibrium. We demonstrate the surprising result that for a given polymorph pair, a decrease in interface-parallel stresses can make a high-pressure polymorph more stable relative to a low-pressure polymorph on the given interface.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The effects of non-hydrostatic stress on mineral assemblages are most likely to be seen in dry systems. Many reactions in metamorphic systems are fluid-mediated, and fluids cannot sustain non-hydrostatic stress. Consequently, in systems with interconnected, fluid-filled porosity, mineral assemblages will tend to form at a pressure approximately equal to the fluid pressure. In contrast, in dry systems all reactions occur directly between solids which can sustain non-hydrostatic stress. This facilitates the application of non-hydrostatic thermodynamics. Consequently, dry rocks containing polymorphs such as such as quartzites, marbles, and peridotites represent ideal lithologies for the testing and application of these concepts. By influencing the chemical potential of solid interfaces, non-hydrostatic stress alters the thermodynamic driving force and subsequent kinetics of polymorphic reactions. This likely results in preferential orientations of polymorphs which could influence seismic anisotropy and potentially generate seismicity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[1] Larch&amp;amp;#233;, F., &amp;amp; Cahn, J.

However, discoveries of high pressure melt inclusions are still a relative rarity among case studies of inclusions in metamorphic minerals. Here we present the results of experimental and microchemical investigations of nanogranitoids in garnets from the felsic granulites of the Central Maine Terrane (Connecticut, US). Their successful experimental re-homogenization at ~2 GPa confirms that they originally were trapped portions of deep melts and makes them the first direct evidence of high pressure during peak metamorphism and melting for these felsic granulites. The trapped melt has a hydrous, granitic, and peraluminous character typical of crustal melts from metapelites. This melt is higher in mafic components (FeO and MgO) than most of the nanogranitoids investigated previously, likely the result of the extreme melting temperatures &amp;amp;#8211; well above 1000&amp;amp;#176;C. This is the first natural evidence of the positive correlation between temperature and mafic character of the melt, a trend previously supported only by experimental evidence.

Gold deposits, characterized by quartz lode or disseminated styles of mineralization with extensive alteration of wall rock, of the Jiaodong Peninsula and Liaodong Peninsula are underlain by rocks of similar geological settings characterized by uplifted blocks of metamorphosed Archean and Proterozoic rocks surrounded by relatively unmetamorphosed Mesoproterozoic rocks and Mesozoic granitoid plutons. The huge order-of-magnitude difference in reserves between the Liaodong gold province (500 t) and the Jiaodong gold province (5000 t) attract the attention of geologists. Different C–H-O-S-Pb isotopes and isotopic dating have sparked controversy over the source of the gold deposits. In this study, we conducted integrated analyses of zircon U-Pb dating, bulk-rock compositions, mineralogical compositions and high-precision gold analyses on a series of meta-clastic sedimentary rocks from the Paleoproterozoic Liaohe Group in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, North China Craton, of which the Au analyses reveal Au mobilization during prograde metamorphism. In the Gaizhou Barrovian-type metamorphic zone, the bulk-rock Au contents of samples within various metamorphic zones show a monotonic decrease up-temperature, from 2.09 ppb in the chlorite zone to 0.07 ppb in the sillimanite zone. The evolution in Au content during prograde metamorphism of other formations are identical to that of the Gaixian Formation. The Au concentrations of biotite in different metamorphic zones show little variation ranging from 0.66 to 0.35 ppb, whereas the Au concentrations of muscovite in different metamorphic zones mainly decrease from 2.60 ppb in the chlorite zone to 0.57 ppb in the sillimanite zone with increasing metamorphic grade in samples without metallic sulfides. Coincidently, there is a dechlorination process in biotites during regional metamorphism. Chlorine, released by metamorphism, may have played a vital role in the migration of Au, which could absorb onto muscovite and other minerals, during prograde metamorphism. Given an Au content of 4.67 t/km3 in the chlorite zone rock approximately equivalent to the protolith, metamorphism up to upper amphibolite grade would force the rocks to release 52% of the Au in the Gaizhou Barrovian-type metamorphic zone. Taking into account previous studies in the interpretation of our results, we propose that Precambrian rocks, such as the meta-clastic sedimentary rocks of the Gaixian Formation, may have contributed considerable amounts of Au to the Liaodong gold province. The Liaohe Group releasing large amounts of Au during Paleoproterozoic metamorphism, may thus provide the primary Au enrichment for the Mesozoic gold deposits.", "authors": ["Weilong Cui", "Jinghui Guo", "Guangyu Huang", "Zaicong Wang", "Yanhong Liu", "Jin‐Hui Yang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104624", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104624", "published": "2021-12-02T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Ore Geology Reviews", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "碎屑沉积岩进变质作用过程中的金活化：以华北克拉通胶辽吉带辽河群为例", "domain": "矿床学与成矿", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文探讨胶辽吉带辽河群变质碎屑岩在进变质作用中金的迁移机制及其对金矿成因的贡献。", "methodology": "采用锆石U-Pb定年、全岩和矿物成分及高精度金含量分析，研究辽河群变质碎屑岩。", "key_findings": "进变质作用使全岩金含量随变质程度升高而下降，释放52%金，黑云母脱氯作用可能促进金迁移。", "innovation": "定量揭示进变质作用中金的显著迁移，提出氯气释放是金迁移关键，为金初次富集提供新机制。", "relevance_note": "为胶辽吉带金矿来源提供重要证据，揭示前寒武纪岩石作为中生代金矿初次富集源的潜力。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1021/acs.analchem.1c04497", "title": "Isotopic Analysis by Laser Ablation Solution Sampling MC-ICP-MS─An Example of Boron", "abstract": "Using boron as a test analyte, laser ablation (LA) solution sampling multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) is proposed and validated as a fast method for isotopic analysis in natural liquids and digested samples without any prior purification process.

With a discrete and minimal sample solvent loading by the LA sampling strategy, it produces nearly \"dry\" plasma conditions that tolerate the sample matrix remarkably. The memory effect, one of the most difficult challenges in boron analysis, was dramatically eliminated with only 15 s wash time; thus, each analysis took less than 100 s. No significant matrix effects were observed for varying 50-100% boron concentrations in the samples and varying 20-60% NH<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O matrix used for the dilution, as well as for samples doped with a 1/100 synthetic seawater matrix.

Critical units are the basement Søstrene Orthogneiss (1,126 ± 11 Ma protolith) and cover Brattstrand Paragneiss (maximum depositional age 1,023 ± 19 Ma). The two units share a polymetamorphic history with events at ~900 Ma (D 1 ) and ~530 Ma (D 2‐4 ). Here we present electron microprobe dates of monazite growth zones and Perple_X pseudosection models of granulite‐facies rocks from the Søstrene Orthogneiss, Brattstrand Paragneiss, and D 2‐4 pegmatites of the Larsemann Hills. We propose a scenario for Cambrian metamorphism involving a peak stage at 6–7.5 kbar and 800–860°C (D 2 convergence), melt crystallization and garnet breakdown during decompression to early retrograde conditions of 3–4.5 kbar and 700–750°C (D 2 convergence, D 3 extension), and a late retrograde stage with decompression and cooling to 3–3.5 kbar and 550–650°C (D 4 ). We combine monazite chemistry with phase assemblages predicted by pseudosection modelling to link specific monazite growth domains to individual tectonic stages. Monazite domains containing moderate Th and low to moderate Y are interpreted to be preserved from the prograde path when garnet was stable, and constrain the timing of prograde metamorphism at 536 ± 4 Ma. High‐Th, low‐Y domains, dated at 527 ± 2 Ma, represent the earliest stages of post‐peak melt crystallization. Monazite domains with elevated Y and low‐moderate Th are interpreted to represent monazite growth during garnet breakdown at 514 ± 2 Ma. Our monazite ages, combined with published biotite Ar–Ar cooling ages, yield a two‐stage history of cooling at 3–8°C/Myr from ~530 Ma to ~510 Ma followed by cooling at 18–25°C/Myr from ~510 Ma to ~490 Ma, corresponding to 0.2–0.6 mm/yr of exhumation.

Three principal age groups of porphyroblast are demonstrated with distinctly oriented inclusion-trails. Inclusion-trail curvature axes or ‘FIA’ (Foliation Inflexion/Intersection Axes) are shown to represent ‘fossilized’ crenulation axes from which a succession of different crustal shortening directions can be deduced. The regional consistency of inclusion-trail orientations and their geometric relationship with several sets of macroscopic folds reveal the composite character of the Gibraltar Arc formed by a superposition of different folding directions and associated lineations. Bulk-garnet ages of 35-22Ma obtained from 5 micaschist samples of the Alpujarride-Sebtide complex (ASC) and of 35-13Ma from 4 micaschists of the Nevado-Filabride complex (NFC) allow to deduce NNE-SSW directed shortening in the Late Eocene changing to NW-SE shortening in the early Oligocene, alternating with suborthogonal NE-SW shortening during the Miocene. These directions can be related to a major swing in the direction of relative Africa-Iberia plate-motion known from kinematic modeling of magnetic seafloor anomalies, and dynamic interference between plate convergence and suborthogonal ‘tectonic escape’ of the Alboran Domain thereafter. Coupled to previously established P-T-t paths, the new garnet ages support a common tectono-metamorphic evolution of the ASC and NFC since the Late Eocene. However, while the first became exhumed in the Middle-Miocene (15Ma), the second experienced a re-subduction prior to being exhumed itself about 5 Myr later.", "authors": ["Domingo Aerden", "Thomas P.

One of the prerequisites of the ID method is knowledge of the isotopic composition of an enriched spike, which is often challenging to accurately determine. In this study, we employ a regression mass bias correction model to accurately and precisely measure the isotopic composition of an enriched Hf spike (Lot No. 159293, Oak Ridge National Laboratory). A NIST SRM 3134 Re solution, whose isotopic composition was calibrated by an NRC IRIS‐1 Ir isotope standard, was used to calibrate the isotopic composition of the Hf spike. The obtained ratios of 176 Hf/ 177 Hf, 179 Hf/ 177 Hf and 180 Hf/ 177 Hf were 0.2406 ± 0.0005 ( u, k = 1), 2.8620 ± 0.0005 ( u, k = 1) and 384.65 ± 0.05 ( u, k = 1), respectively, which meet the required precision levels for Hf isotopes in the application of the ID method. The combined uncertainties of the calibrated Re and Hf isotope ratios were evaluated using a Monte Carlo method, in which the uncertainty of the primary calibrator (IRIS‐1, 193 Ir/ 191 Ir = 1.6866 ± 0.0005, u , k = 1) was also taken into consideration. The precision of Hf spike was improved significantly compared with the SSB and C‐SSBIN methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of isotope ratio calibration in an enriched spike using the regression model. The precisely calibrated spike can lower the uncertainty of the Hf mass fraction significantly, thereby increasing the accuracy of the Lu‐Hf chronometer.", "authors": ["Ran Lin", "Jie Lin", "Keqing Zong", "Kang Chen", "Shuoyun Tong", "Lanping Feng", "Wen Zhang", "Ming Li", "Yongsheng Liu", "Zhaochu Hu", "Lian Zhou"], "doi": "10.1111/ggr.12343", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ggr.12343", "published": "2020-05-29T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "使用回归模型通过MC-ICP-MS测定富集铪示踪剂的同位素组成", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在精确测定富集 Hafnium (Hf) 示踪剂的同位素组成，这是同位素稀释法（ID）的关键前提。", "methodology": "采用回归质量歧视校正模型，结合NIST SRM 3134 Re溶液校准和蒙特卡洛方法评估不确定性，通过MC-ICP-MS测定Hf示踪剂同位素组成。", "key_findings": "测得的Hf同位素比值（176Hf/177Hf, 179Hf/177Hf, 180Hf/177Hf）精度高，满足同位素稀释法要求，且显著优于SSB和C-SSBIN方法。", "innovation": "这是首次报道使用回归模型对富集示踪剂进行同位素比值校准的方法。", "relevance_note": "精确校准的Hf示踪剂能显著降低Hf质量分数的测定不确定性，从而提高Lu-Hf年代计的准确性。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1111/ggr.12356", "title": "Non‐Matrix‐Matched Determination of Th‐Pb Ages in Zircon, Monazite and Xenotime by Laser Ablation‐Inductively Coupled Plasma‐Mass Spectrometry", "abstract": "Similar to the U‐Pb system, the 232 Th‐ 208 Pb decay scheme is also widely utilised in geochronology of Th‐rich accessory minerals. The matrix‐dependent systemic deviations observed between different accessory minerals and the paucity of well‐characterised reference materials for some minerals of interest (e.g., xenotime and allanite) are the major obstacles to yield accurate and precise Th‐Pb ages with laser ablation‐inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry (LA‐ICP‐MS). In this study, we investigated the effects of the addition of nitrogen, oxygen and water vapour before the ablation cell on the accuracy of Th‐Pb dating of accessory minerals (i.e., zircon, monazite and xenotime) using NIST SRM 610 glass as the calibrating reference material. Our results demonstrate that the measured 208 Pb/ 232 Th ages in zircon, monazite and xenotime were approximately 9–24% lower than their isotope dilution thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (ID‐TIMS) ages in normal ablation (without addition of additional gases). The measured 208 Pb/ 232 Th ages of zircon (Plešovice, M257 and Qinghu), monazite (44069 and Trebilcock) and xenotime (BS‐1 and MG‐1) showed excellent agreement with their respective reference values with the addition of small amounts of water vapour before the ablation cell.

Our study shows that they originated from an Archean fluid-metasomatized refractory peridotite source, in which highly unradiogenic lead was preferentially released with subducted Archean seawater and sequestered into recrystallized sulfides at shallow mantle depths. Sulfide/silicate partition coefficients for lead show a negative pressure dependence: Lead is more enriched in sulfide with decreasing pressure. Sulfide-bearing and iron-poor harzburgite as well as dunite residues at shallow mantle are expected to develop low U/Pb (and thereby low time-integrated 206Pb/204Pb) relative to a deeper upper-mantle source.

Likewise, the origin of the evolved Acadian (Devonian) plutonism in the New England Appalachians (northeastern USA) has long been explained by closed-system crustal melting due to the absence of associated coeval deep mafic counterparts. Here, we report the discovery of Acadian hydrous ultramafic cumulate rocks that formed by deep-seated (∼1.1 GPa) fractional crystallization processes from a mantle-derived parental melt (Connecticut, southern New England, USA). These rocks are the first of their kind identified in the Appalachian orogen, and one of only a handful of preserved deep subarc hydrous cumulates worldwide. We propose a genetic link between the studied rocks and the evolved coeval plutonism in central-southern New England, where the former represent the missing deep cumulate roots of the same magmatic arc. Our findings support the hypothesis that differentiation of mantle-derived hydrous magmas by fractional crystallization and assimilation processes in the deep crust is a fundamental process in the production of intermediate to silicic magmatism and the geochemical evolution of the continental crust.", "authors": ["Santiago Tassara", "Jay J.

This contribution presents field, geochemical and zircon U–Pb age and Hf isotope results of four different 3.32–3.25 Ga granitoid bodies from the northern part of Singhbhum Craton to investigate their petrogenesis and role in crustal evolution. The granitoids range in composition from tonalites to trondhjemites, derived from intracrustal melting at low- to medium-pressure conditions. The source was mainly low-K mafic rock. The granitoids show intrasuite fractional crystallization. These sodic granitoids represent the last stage of granitoid magmatism in the Singhbhum Craton which formed contemporaneously with K-rich granitoids occurring in other parts of the craton. This fact suggests that, contrary to the popular notion (of only potassic granitoids), both sodic and potassic granitoids could form at the terminal phase of cratonization, implying reworking of heterogeneous (mafic to tonalite) crust. A combination of evidence from geochemical data, secular change in granitoid composition, structural pattern and rock association of the Singhbhum Craton reflects that recurring mantle plume-related mafic–ultramafic magma emplacement in an oceanic plateau setting and attendant crustal melting can explain the Paleoarchean crustal evolution pattern.", "authors": ["Sukanta Dey", "Sibani Kumari Nayak", "Aniruddha Mitra", "Keqing Zong", "Yongsheng Liu"], "doi": "10.1144/sp489-2019-202", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1144/sp489-2019-202", "published": "2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Geological Society London Special Publications", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "印度东部辛格布姆克拉通北部花岗岩类中记录的古太古代大陆地壳形成机制", "domain": "岩石学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在探讨辛格布姆克拉通古太古代花岗岩的岩石成因及其在地壳演化中的作用，并阐明钠质到富钾岩浆作用转变的地球动力学意义。", "methodology": "研究采用了野外考察、地球化学分析、锆石U-Pb定年和Hf同位素分析方法，对辛格布姆克拉通北部的四个花岗岩体进行了研究。", "key_findings": "古太古代花岗岩体由低钾基性岩地壳内熔融形成；克拉通化末期钠质和钾质花岗岩可同时形成，表明地壳异质性重塑；地幔柱活动和地壳熔融解释了克拉通演化模式。", "innovation": "挑战了关于克拉通化末期仅形成钾质花岗岩的传统观点，提出钠质和钾质花岗岩可同时形成，并揭示了异质地壳重塑。", "relevance_note": "为理解古太古代地壳演化模式提供了新的见解，特别是地幔柱活动在克拉通形成中的作用，对早期地球动力学研究有重要价值。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1594/pangaea.921736", "title": "Oxygen, hydrogen and strontium isotope compositions from serpentinites and ophicalcites form the Northern Apennine ophiolite sequence", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Esther M.

However, discoveries of high-pressure melt inclusions are still a relative rarity among case studies of inclusions in metamorphic minerals. Here we present the results of experimental and microchemical investigations of nanogranitoids in garnets from the felsic granulites of the Central Maine Terrane (Connecticut, U.S.A.). Their successful experimental re-homogenization at ~2 GPa confirms that they originally were trapped portions of deep melts and makes them the first direct evidence of high pressure during peak metamorphism and melting for these felsic granulites. The trapped melt has a hydrous, granitic, and peraluminous character typical of crustal melts from metapelites. This melt is higher in mafic components (FeO and MgO) than most of the nanogranitoids investigated previously, likely the result of the extreme melting temperatures—well above 1000 °C. This is the first natural evidence of the positive correlation between temperature and mafic character of the melt; a trend previously supported only by experimental evidence. Moreover, it poses a severe caveat against the common assumption that partial melts from metasediments at depth are always leucogranitic in composition. NanoSIMS measurement on re-homogenized inclusions show significant amounts of CO2, Cl, and F. Halogen abundance in the melt is considered to be a proxy for the presence of brines (strongly saline fluids) at depth. Brines are known to shift the melting temperatures of the system toward higher values and may have been responsible for delaying melt production via biotite dehydration melting until these rocks reached extreme temperatures of more than 1000 °C, rather than 800–850 °C as commonly observed for these reactions.", "authors": ["Silvio Ferrero", "Jay J.

"Abstract. Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are useful molecular indicators for organic carbon (OC) sources and the paleoenvironment. Their application in marine environments, however, is complicated because of a mixed terrestrial and marine source. Here, we examined brGDGTs in sediments from the Mariana Trench, the deepest ocean without significant terrestrial influence. Our result shows a strong predominance of hexamethylated 6-methyl brGDGT (IIIa′) (73.40±2.39 % of total brGDGTs) and an absence of 5-methyl brGDGTs, different from previously reported soils and marine sediments that comprised both 5-methyl and 6-methyl brGDGTs. This unique feature, combined with high δ13COC (-19.82±0.25 %), low OC∕TN ratio (6.72±0.84), low branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index (0.03±0.01), and high acyclic hexa- ∕ pentamethylated brGDGT ratio (7.13±0.98), support that brGDGTs in the Mariana Trench sediments are autochthonous rather than terrestrial products.

These granitoids range from sodic TTGs to evolved, potassic granites. &amp;amp;#160;The whole process of their formation, starting from nucleation of a juvenile continent to its evolution and final stabilization is documented. The central part of the craton started nucleating with the formation of 3.45&amp;amp;#8211;3.40Ga juvenile (zircon &amp;amp;#949;Hf&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;t&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;=+0.6 to +7.1) TTGs. These TTGs characterized by slightly depleted HREE and Y, negligible Eu-anomaly (Eu/Eu*=0.90 to 1.00) and moderate Sr/Y (25&amp;amp;#8211;64), consistent with derivation from a low-K mafic crust at a pressure near the lower end of the garnet stability field, causing subordinate garnet retention in the residue and negligible role of plagioclase. During 3.32Ga, deeper melting of a juvenile mafic crust (zircon &amp;amp;#949;Hf&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;t&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;=+1.3 to +5.7) caused emplacement of a second generation of TTG. Deeper melting is suggested by depleted HREE and Y, and high Sr/Y (52&amp;amp;#8211;155), implying significant amount of residual garnet retention. Subsequently at 3.28 and 3.25Ga, melting of moderately old to juvenile (zircon &amp;amp;#949;Hf&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;t&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;=-1.9 to +4.5), mostly TTG sources at variable depths generated potassic, LILE-enriched, high-silica granites. Intrusion of these potassic granites resulted in a stable and buoyant crust that marked the final Cratonization of the Singhbhum Craton. The sequence of events is interpreted in terms of repeated intracrustal melting and granitoid generation in a gradually thickening oceanic plateau with a progressive change in granitoid source from mafic to felsic in composition. Combination of rock assemblage, regional geology, and structural pattern also supports intraplate nature of the magmatism in Singhbhum Craton, which might have been a significant mechanism of crustal growth worldwide during Paleoarchean.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;", "authors": ["Aniruddha Mitra", "Sukanta Dey", "Keqing Zong", "Yongsheng Liu", "Anirban Mitra"], "doi": "10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-1142", "url": "https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-1142", "published": "2020-03-09T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": null, "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "印度东部辛格布姆克拉通的古太古宙地壳演化：来自花岗岩类岩石学和锆石U-Pb与Lu-Hf同位素体系的启示", "domain": "构造地质学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在揭示印度辛格布姆克拉通古太古代地壳演化和克拉通化的过程。", "methodology": "研究采用了花岗岩岩石学、锆石U-Pb定年和Lu-Hf同位素体系分析方法。", "key_findings": "辛格布姆克拉通经历了从3.45Ga的TTG到3.25Ga钾质花岗岩的演化，通过重复的壳内熔融和岩浆作用最终形成稳定的地壳。", "innovation": "研究提出古太古代辛格布姆克拉通的岩浆作用具有板内性质，这可能代表了全球地壳生长的重要机制。", "relevance_note": "这项研究通过详细的岩石学和同位素证据，为理解古太古代地壳生长和克拉通化过程提供了关键见解。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-13454", "title": "On the fO2 of slab fluids in subduction zone systems", "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the most pressing riddles of the subduction cycle to be solved is linked to the fO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of the slab-released fluids. It is now well accepted that the fluids liberated during slab dehydration play a crucial role in subduction zone seismicity, element cycling, and arc magmatism. However, whether these slab fluids are oxidizing or reducing transport agents is poorly understood and thus, there is still a lot we need to understand. This is of particular importance for gaining a mechanistic view on the formation processes of economically important arc related ore deposits, which certainly require understanding of the behavior of redox sensitive mobilities of the relevant elements. In brief, while some field-based studies from the slab perspective are suggesting rather reduced conditions (e.g., based on sulfides and sulfur isotope work, ref. 1) others, mainly related to higher temperature systems (e.g., based on bulk-rock &amp;amp;#8211; rutile systems and molybdenum isotope work, ref. 2), are indicative of more oxidizing slab fluids. Especially for m&amp;amp;#233;lange-like structures developed at the plate interface, studies on sulfur-bearing minerals result in contrasting fO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of the related slab fluids (ref. 3 vs ref. 4). It appears that at least during retrogression along the plate interface the reactively flowing fluids tend to have a more oxidizing potential (ref. 5). Interestingly, the prime fluid source of subducting slabs, i.e. dehydrating slab mantle serpentinites, is thought to release reduced fluids (ref. 6) but melt inclusions in arc volcanic rocks are often oxidized. Recent studies suggest that this is likely linked to fluid-rock interaction at local scales (ref. 7) and/or possibly within the magma reservoirs that comprise rather low-melt-fraction mush (ref. 8). This in turn would suggest that the slab fluids might change their fO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; during reactive intra-slab fluid flow, or would not need to be oxidized prior to melt inclusion entrapment and that the oxidizing potential of the fluids may be the result of magmatic processes during melt ascent in the arc. In this contribution we review the current state of knowledge, provide new ideas and models regarding channelized though reactive intra-slab fluid flow, and illustrate the next steps to unravel this exiting and thus far poorly understood topic of subduction zone element cycling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1]&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; Li, J.-L., et al.

Their evolution during metamorphism largely controls the fate of carbon, regulating its fluxes between shallow and deep reservoirs. Recent estimates predict that almost all subducted carbon is transferred into the crust and lithospheric mantle during subduction metamorphism via decarbonation and dissolution reactions at high-pressure conditions. Here we report the occurrence of eclogite-facies marbles associated with metasomatic systems in Alpine Corsica (France). The occurrence of these marbles along major fluid-conduits as well as textural, geochemical and isotopic data indicating fluid–mineral reactions are compelling evidence for the precipitation of these carbonate-rich assemblages from carbonic fluids during metamorphism. The discovery of metasomatic marbles brings new insights into the fate of carbonic fluids formed in subducting slabs. We infer that rock carbonation can occur at high-pressure conditions by either vein-injection or chemical replacement mechanisms. This indicates that carbonic fluids produced by decarbonation reactions and carbonate dissolution may not be directly transferred to the mantle wedge, but can interact with slab and mantle-forming rocks. Rock-carbonation by fluid–rock interactions may have an important impact on the residence time of carbon and oxygen in subduction zones and lithospheric mantle reservoirs as well as carbonate isotopic signatures in subduction zones.

Here, we evaluated the expression of B12, CD272 and miR-16 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. The results showed that monocytes expressing CD272 or B12 were down-regulated in patients with tuberculosis. The expression of B12 and CD272 in T cells and monocytes is related to tuberculosis. In TB patients, the up-regulation of miR-16 was negatively correlated with B12 mRNA expression, miR-16 was mainly expressed in CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, and CD272 mRNA was mainly expressed in CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells. It is worth noting that the overexpression of miR-16 inhibits the expression of CD272 and B12 in monocytes of TB patients.

The lncRNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript (MALAT)-1 has been widely studied in cancer. In this review, we describe the known functions of MALAT-1; its mechanisms of action; and associated signaling pathways and their clinical significance in different cancers. In most malignancies, including lung, colorectal, thyroid, and other cancers, MALAT-1 functions as an oncogene and is upregulated in tumors and tumor cell lines. MALAT-1 has a distinct mechanism of action in each cancer type and is thus at the center of large gene regulatory networks. Dysregulation of MALAT-1 affects cellular processes such as alternative splicing, epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition, apoptosis, and autophagy, which ultimately results in the abnormal cell proliferation, invasion, and migration that characterize cancers. In other malignancies, such as glioma and endometrial carcinoma, MALAT-1 functions as a tumor suppressor and thus forms additional regulatory networks. The current evidence indicates that MALAT-1 and its associated signaling pathways can serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target in the treatment of many cancers.Keywords: long noncoding RNA, tumorigenesis, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, regulatory cascade, oncogene, tumor suppressor", "authors": ["Fu S", "Yuluang Wang", "Hung‐Yuan Li", "L Chen", "Yongsheng Liu"], "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W4287653765", "published": "2020-10-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "LncRNA MALAT-1 在癌症中的调控网络", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在阐述长非编码RNA MALAT-1在不同癌症中的功能、作用机制、相关信号通路及其临床意义。", "methodology": "本文采用综述方法，总结并描述了现有关于MALAT-1在癌症中的研究。", "key_findings": "MALAT-1在多数癌症中作为致癌基因，但在某些癌症中作为抑癌基因，通过调控多种细胞过程影响肿瘤进展。", "innovation": "本文系统性地总结了MALAT-1在不同癌症中作为致癌基因或抑癌基因的复杂调控网络和独特作用机制。", "relevance_note": "这项研究为MALAT-1作为癌症诊断、预后生物标志物或治疗靶点的开发提供了重要理论依据。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "W4309237333", "title": "MicroRNA-200c Nanoparticles Sensitized Gastric Cancer Cells to Radiotherapy by Regulating PD-L1 Expression and EMT", "abstract": "Lingyu Qian,1,2,* Fangcen Liu,3,* Yanhong Chu,1 Qingqing Zhai,1 Xiao Wei,3 Jie Shao,1 Rutian Li,1 Qiuping Xu,1 Lixia Yu,1 Baorui Liu,1 Qin Liu1 1The Comprehensive Cancer Centre of Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical School &amp; Clinical Cancer Institute of Nanjing University, Nanjing, People&rsquo;s Republic of China; 2Department of Oncology, Rudong Peoples&rsquo; Hospital of Jiangsu Province, Nantong, People&rsquo;s Republic of China; 3Department of Pathology, Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, People&rsquo;s Republic of China*These authors contributed equally to this workCorrespondence: Qin LiuThe Comprehensive Cancer Centre of Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical School &amp; Clinical Cancer Institute of Nanjing University, Nanjing 210008, People&rsquo;s Republic of ChinaEmail liuqinxh@126.comIntroduction: Immuno-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in advanced gastric cancer either as monotherapy or in combining strategies are rapidly evolving but still in early phase. Various efforts have been made to provide insights into regulating immune checkpoint molecule programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression to improve ICIs efficacy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and potential mechanism of miR-200c nanoparticles combined with radiotherapy in gastric cancer cells.Methods: We prepared miR-200c-loaded nanoparticles (miR-200c NPs) to achieve targeted delivery of miR-200c to AGS cells. The roles of miR-200c NPs and radiotherapy in regulating the viability of AGS cells were assessed by CCK-8 toxicity test and Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis kit. Flow cytometry was used to analyze expression of PD-L1 and CD44 on the surface of AGS cells treated by miR-200c NPs and/or ionizing radiation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to test the level of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-&beta; 1) secreted by AGS cells. The cooperation mechanism between miR-200c NPs and radiotherapy was also explored in vitro.Results: Compared with naked miR-200c mimics, miR-200c NPs significantly downregulated PD-L1 expression of gastric cancer cells. The combination of miR-200c NPs and radiotherapy showed significantly synergistic inhibitory effect on gastric cancer cells by inhibiting immune escape mediated by PD-L1, reversing EMT phenotype as well as abrogating cancer stem cells (CSCs)-associated properties of tumor cells.Conclusion: MiR-200c NPs sensitized gastric cancer cells to radiotherapy by regulating PD-L1 expression and EMT.Keywords: microRNA-200c, gastric cancer, nanoparticle, PD-L1, radiotherapy", "authors": ["L Qian", "Fan Liu", "Chu Y", "Q Zhai", "Wei Xin", "J Shao", "Ren‐Ke Li", "Qiong Xu", "Lu Yu", "Liu B", "Yongsheng Liu"], "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W4309237333", "published": "2020-11-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "MicroRNA-200c纳米颗粒通过调节PD-L1表达和EMT，增强胃癌细胞对放疗的敏感性", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本研究旨在探讨miR-200c纳米颗粒联合放疗对胃癌细胞的作用及其潜在机制。", "methodology": "研究制备了miR-200c纳米颗粒，并通过CCK-8、Annexin V-FITC/PI、流式细胞术和ELISA等体外实验评估其与放疗对胃癌细胞的影响及机制。", "key_findings": "miR-200c纳米颗粒显著下调PD-L1表达，并与放疗协同抑制胃癌细胞，通过抑制PD-L1介导的免疫逃逸、逆转EMT和消除CSC特性。", "innovation": "创新性地利用miR-200c纳米颗粒与放疗结合，通过调控PD-L1表达和EMT，增强胃癌细胞对放疗的敏感性。", "relevance_note": "本研究为提高胃癌放疗疗效和改善免疫检查点抑制剂疗效提供了新的策略和机制见解，对肿瘤治疗领域具有重要价值。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "W4313232408", "title": "Ursolic Acid Protects Against Proliferation and Inflammatory Response in LPS-Treated Gastric Tumour Model and Cells by Inhibiting NLRP3 Inﬂammasome Activation", "abstract": "Zixi Chen,* Qiaoli Liu,* Zhaowei Zhu, Fenfen Xiang, Mengzhe Zhang, Rong Wu, Xiangdong Kang Department of Laboratory Medicine, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200062, People&rsquo;s Republic of China*These authors contributed equally to this workCorrespondence: Xiangdong Kang; Rong WuDepartment of Laboratory Medicine, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 164 Lanxi Road, Shanghai 200062, People&rsquo;s Republic of ChinaEmail xd_kang@163.com; rong701@126.comBackground: Inflammation is considered as one of the hallmarks of cancer development and progression. Ursolic acid (UA) showed strong effects as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. However, the anti-cancer effects of ursolic acid require further study.Methods: This study aimed to investigate the role of ursolic acid in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated gastric tumour mouse model and in a human gastric carcinoma cell line (BGC-823 cells). This study also aimed to confirm whether ursolic acid can protect against proliferation and the inflammatory response induced by LPS, by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via the NF-&kappa;B pathway.Results: The present study demonstrated that ursolic acid significantly attenuated LPS-treated proliferation in a gastric tumour mouse model and the human gastric carcinoma BGC-823 cell line, reduced the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome and suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

However, the role of circRNAs in cervical cancer (CC) is largely unknown. Here, we characterized the role of circRNA_101308 in CC.Materials and Methods: The expression of circRNA_101308 in CC tissues was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, circRNA_101308 was overexpressed in CC cells to detect its function by proliferation and apoptosis assays, Transwell assays and animal experiments. The potential mechanism of circRNA_101308 in CC was explored by RNA pull-down, Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses.Results: CircRNA_101308 was significantly downregulated in CC tissues. The level of circRNA_101308 was much lower in CC patients with lymph node metastasis or deep myometrial invasion compared to those patients without lymph node metastasis and superficial myometrial invasion. CircRNA_101308 overexpression inhibited CC cell proliferation, invasion and migration.

However, the lack of high selectivity for &alpha;2A-AR subtype of traditional drugs greatly limits their clinic usage.Methods: A series of homobivalent 4-aminoquinolines conjugated by two 4-aminoquinoline moieties via varying alkane linker length (C2-C12) were characterized for their affinities for each &alpha;2-AR subtype. Subsequently, docking, molecular dynamics and mutagenesis were applied to uncover the molecular mechanism.Results: Most 4-aminoquinolines (4-aminoquinoline monomer, C2-C6, C8-C10) were selective for &alpha;2A-AR over &alpha;2B- and &alpha;2C-ARs. Besides, the affinities are of similar linker length-dependence for each &alpha;2-AR subtype. Among all the compounds tested, C10 has the highest affinity for &alpha;2A-AR (pKi=&minus; 7.45&plusmn; 0.62), which is 12-fold and 60-fold selective over &alpha;2B-AR and &alpha;2C-AR, respectively. Docking and molecular dynamics suggest that C10 simultaneously interacts with orthosteric and &ldquo;allosteric&rdquo; sites of the &alpha;2A-AR. The mutation of F205 decreases the affinity by 2-fold. The potential allosteric residues include S90, N93, E94 and W99.Conclusion: The specificity of C10 for the &alpha;2A-AR and the potential orthosteric and allosteric binding sites proposed in this study provide valuable guidance for the development of novel &alpha;2A-AR subtype selective compounds.Keywords: alpha2-adrenoceptor, selectivity, linker length, allosteric modulation", "authors": ["Zhongrui Li", "Li J", "Lei Liu", "Wen Deng", "Yongsheng Liu", "Rui Liu", "Wei Zhang", "Zhongshi He", "Li Fan", "Yang Yu", "Yuxiao Duan", "Hesheng Hou", "X Wang", "Yang Zhang", "X Wang", "Shiping Chen", "Yi Wang", "Niu Huang", "Jun Chen"], "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W4384613125", "published": "2020-07-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "4-氨基喹啉类化合物对alpha2A-肾上腺素受体选择性机制的结构洞察", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在揭示4-氨基喹啉类化合物对α2A-肾上腺素受体选择性的分子机制，以克服传统药物选择性差的局限。", "methodology": "研究通过合成一系列不同连接臂长度的4-氨基喹啉同二聚体，评估其对α2-AR亚型的亲和力，并结合分子对接、分子动力学模拟和诱变实验揭示作用机制。", "key_findings": "大多数4-氨基喹啉对α2A-AR具有选择性，其中C10对α2A-AR亲和力最高，且同时与正构和变构位点结合，F205突变和S90、N93、E94、W99等残基影响其结合。", "innovation": "本研究首次揭示了C10化合物对α2A-AR的高选择性及其正构与变构结合模式，并识别了关键结合残基，为新型选择性药物设计提供了结构基础。", "relevance_note": "该研究为开发治疗中枢神经系统退行性疾病的、具有高选择性的新型α2A-AR激动剂提供了重要的结构指导和理论依据。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "W4385375323", "title": "Superior Antitumor Efficacy of IFN-&alpha;2b-Incorporated Photo-Cross-Linked Hydrogels Combined with T Cell Transfer and Low-Dose Irradiation Against Gastric Cancer", "abstract": "Qin Liu,1,* Dinghu Zhang,1,2,* Hanqing Qian,1 Yanhong Chu,1 Yan Yang,3 Jie Shao,1 Qiuping Xu,1 Baorui Liu1 1The Comprehensive Cancer Centre of Drum Tower Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Clinical Cancer Institute of Nanjing University, Nanjing, People&rsquo;s Republic of China; 2Department of Radiology, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, People&rsquo;s Republic of China; 3Department of Oncology, Jiangning Hospital, Nanjing, People&rsquo;s Republic of China*These authors contributed equally to this workCorrespondence: Baorui LiuThe Comprehensive Cancer Centre of Drum Tower Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Clinical Cancer Institute of Nanjing University, Nanjing 210008, People&rsquo;s Republic of ChinaTel +86 25-83107081Fax +86 25-83317016Email baoruiliu@nju.edu.cnIntroduction: The exhaustion and poor homing of activated lymphocytes are critical obstacles in adoptive cell immunotherapy for solid tumors. In order to effectively deliver immune cells into tumors, we encapsulated interferon-&alpha; 2b (IFN-&alpha; 2b) into macroporous hydrogels as an enhancement factor and utilized low-dose irradiation (LDI) as a tumoral attractor of T cells.Methods: Hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels were prepared by irradiation techniques, and the cross-sectional microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The synergistic antitumor mechanism of combination of IFN-&alpha; 2b and CIK cells was evaluated by detecting the expression of activation marker CD69 on CIK cell surface and IFN-&gamma; production by CIK cells. The in vivo antitumor activity of IFN-&alpha; 2b-incorporated hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels combined with CIK and radiation was evaluated in an MKN-45 xenografted nude mice model.Results: The bioactivity of IFN-&alpha; 2b was well maintained in ultraviolet-reactive, rapidly cross-linkable hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels. In vitro studies demonstrated IFN-&alpha; 2b-activated T cells, as evidenced by upregulating early activation marker CD69 and secretion inflammatory cytokine IFN-&gamma;. In vivo real-time image showed our hydrogels kept a higher amount of drug delivery at the tumor site for a long time compared with free drug injection. Low-dose irradiation promoted T cell accumulation and infiltration in subcutaneous tumors.

Many technologies have been developed and applied to improve the solubility and bioavailability of curcumin, especially the nanotechnology-based delivery systems. However, there has been evidence that certain nanoparticles have potential reproductive toxicity in practice.Methods: Curcumin-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-PEG nanoparticles (Cur-PLGA-NPs for short) were prepared. The Cur-PLGA-NPs were evaluated with its effect on the proliferation of mouse testicular cell lines in vitro and spermatogenesis in vivo, while PLGA-NPs were used as control. For animal experiments, male BALB/c mice were treated with 20 mg/kg of Cur-PLGA-NPs for continuous 10 days via tail vein injection.Results: We found the curcumin nanoparticles suppressed the proliferation of testicular cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, a short-term intravenous delivery of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles could be harmful to the differentiation of spermatogonia, the elongation of spermatids, as well as the motility of mature sperms.Conclusion: In the present study, we disclosed the acute damage on mouse spermatogenesis and sperm parameters by curcumin-loaded nanoparticles.

Rectal carriage of CRKP has been reported playing an important role in CRKP infection; however, the extent to which carrier develops clinical CRKP infection is unclear. This study aimed to identify risk factors for developing subsequential CRKP clinical infection in rectal carriers with CRKP.Patients and Methods: Patients were screened for rectal carriage of CRKP in a tertiary university hospital; then, rectal CRKP carriers were divided into case group (those who developed subsequential clinical infection) and control group. Demographics, comorbid conditions, invasive procedures, antimicrobial exposure and other clinical parameters of those two groups were compared and analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Antimicrobial susceptibility profile and carbapenemase phenotype/genotype of those CRKP isolates were determined. MLST was applied to elucidate the molecular epidemiology of rectal CRKP isolates and clinical infection ones.Results: Eight hundred and thirty-five patients were screened for rectal CRKP carriage. A total of 62 CRKP rectal carriers were identified; among them, 37.1% (23/62) developed CRKP clinical infection. CRKP isolates were resistant to most of the tested antimicrobial agents. ST11 was the dominant MLST type in rectal CRKP isolates (71.0%), and all the 23 clinical infection isolates were ST11. Multivariate analysis revealed that admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR, 6.753; P=0.006), being in coma condition (OR, 11.085; P=0.015) and receiving central venous catheter (OR, 8.628; P=0.003) were independent risk factors for progressing to subsequential CRKP infection among those rectal carriers.Conclusion: This study identified independent risk factors for developing subsequential CRKP clinical infection among CRKP rectal carriers, with being in coma condition as a new finding.

However, the effects of circRNAs on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain largely unexplored. We explored the function of circRAD18 in AML development.Methods: QRT-PCR was performed for the levels of circRAD18, RAD18, microRNA-206 (miR-206) and protein kinase CAMP-activated catalytic subunit beta (PRKACB). Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation assay were utilized for cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out to analyze cell apoptosis and cell cycle process. Transwell assay was manipulated for cell migration and invasion. Western blot assay was conducted for protein levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was adopted to verify the interaction between miR-206 and circRAD18 or PRKACB.Results: CircRAD18 level was increased in AML patients&amp;amp;rsquo; blood specimens and AML cell lines compared to normal controls. CircRAD18 knockdown impeded the proliferation, migration and invasion and facilitated the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in AML cells. Moreover, circRAD18 was identified as a sponge for miR-206, and circRAD18 knockdown-mediated effect on AML cell progression was reversed by miR-206 suppression. Additionally, PRKACB was the target gene of miR-206. MiR-206 overexpression suppressed the malignant behaviors of AML cells, while PRKACB elevation restored the effects.Conclusion: CircRAD18 aggravated the malignancy of AML cells through reducing miR-206 expression and elevating PRKACB expression, indicating circRAD18 might be a therapeutic target for AML.Keywords: AML, circRAD18, miR-206, PRKACB", "authors": ["Yanan Wang", "Guo T", "Yongsheng Liu", "Xie X"], "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W4392577125", "published": "2020-10-30T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "CircRAD18通过调节miR-206/PRKACB轴，加速急性髓系白血病的进展", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在探讨环状RNA circRAD18在急性髓系白血病（AML）发展中的作用及其潜在分子机制。", "methodology": "研究采用QRT-PCR、CCK-8、集落形成、流式细胞术、Transwell、Western blot和双荧光素酶报告基因等多种实验方法。", "key_findings": "circRAD18在AML中高表达并促进其恶性进展，通过作为miR-206的海绵体，上调PRKACB表达，从而加速AML细胞恶性行为。", "innovation": "本研究首次揭示了circRAD18通过调控miR-206/PRKACB轴促进AML进展的分子机制。", "relevance_note": "该研究为AML的诊断和治疗提供了新的生物标志物和潜在的治疗靶点，具有重要的临床转化价值。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "W4393122491", "title": "Enhanced and Prolonged Antitumor Effect of Salinomycin-Loaded Gelatinase-Responsive Nanoparticles via Targeted Drug Delivery and Inhibition of Cervical Cancer Stem Cells", "abstract": "Qin Wang,1,* Fangcen Liu,2,* Lifeng Wang,1 Chen Xie,3 Puyuan Wu,1 Shiyao Du,1 Shujuan Zhou,1 Zhichen Sun,1 Qin Liu,1 Lixia Yu,1 Baorui Liu,1 Rutian Li1 1The Comprehensive Cancer Centre of Drum Tower Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Clinical Cancer Institute of Nanjing University, Nanjing 210008, People&rsquo;s Republic of China; 2The Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Clinical College of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, People&rsquo;s Republic of China; 3Key Laboratory for Organic Electronics and Information Displays, Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Jiangsu National Synergetic Innovation Center for Advanced Materials (SICAM), Nanjing University of Posts &amp; Telecommunications, Nanjing 210023, People&rsquo;s Republic of China*These authors contributed equally to this workCorrespondence: Rutian Li; Baorui LiuThe Comprehensive Cancer Centre of Drum Tower Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Clinical Cancer Institute of Nanjing University, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing 210008, People&rsquo;s Republic of ChinaTel +86-25-83107081Fax +86-25-83317016Email rutianli@nju.edu.cn; baoruiliu@nju.edu.cnBackground: Cervical cancer stem cells (CCSCs) represent a subpopulation of tumor cells that possess self-renewal capacity and numerous intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. These cells play a crucial role in relapse and metastasis of cervical cancer. Therefore, eradication of CCSCs is the primary objective in cervical cancer therapy. Salinomycin (Sal) is an agent used for the elimination of cancer stem cells (CSCs); however, the occurrence of several side effects hinders its application. Nanoscale drug-delivery systems offer great promise for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. These systems can be used to reduce the side effects of Sal and improve clinical benefit.Methods: Sal-loaded polyethylene glycol-peptide-polycaprolactone nanoparticles (Sal NPs) were fabricated under mild and non-toxic conditions. The real-time biodistribution of Sal NPs was investigated through non-invasive near-infrared fluorescent imaging. The efficacy of tumor growth inhibition by Sal NPs was evaluated using tumor xenografts in nude mice. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting were used to detect the apoptosis of CSCs after treatment with Sal NPs. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to examine epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition (epithelial interstitial transformation) signal-related molecules.Results: Sal NPs exhibited antitumor efficacy against cervical cancers by inducing apoptosis of CCSCs and inhibiting the epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition pathway. Besides, tumor pieces resected from Sal NP-treated mice showed decreased reseeding ability and growth speed, further demonstrating the significant inhibitory ability of Sal NPs against CSCs. Moreover, owing to targeted delivery based on the gelatinase-responsive strategy, Sal NPs was more effective and tolerable than free Sal.Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that CCSC-targeted Sal NPs provide a potential approach to selectively target and efficiently eradicate CCSCs. This renders them a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic effect against cervical cancer.Keywords: nanoparticles, salinomycin, tumor-targeted delivery, cancer stem cells, epithelial interstitial transformation", "authors": ["Qian Wang", "Fan Liu", "Li Wang", "Xie Chao", "Peng Wu", "Du S", "Shuzhen Zhou", "Zhong Sun", "Yongsheng Liu", "Yu Lu", "Liu B", "Li R"], "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W4393122491", "published": "2020-02-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "通过靶向药物递送和抑制宫颈癌干细胞，增强和延长负载Salinomycin的明胶酶响应纳米颗粒的抗肿瘤作用", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在开发一种靶向递送Salinomycin的纳米系统，以有效根除宫颈癌干细胞并减少药物副作用。", "methodology": "制造了Salinomycin负载的明胶酶响应纳米颗粒（Sal NPs），并通过体内成像、异种移植模型、流式细胞术、免疫组织化学和Western blotting评估其疗效。", "key_findings": "Sal NPs通过诱导宫颈癌干细胞凋亡和抑制EMT途径，有效抑制肿瘤生长，并表现出比游离Salinomycin更好的疗效和耐受性。", "innovation": "首次证明了靶向宫颈癌干细胞的Salinomycin纳米颗粒能够选择性且高效地根除这些细胞，为宫颈癌治疗提供了新策略。", "relevance_note": "该研究为克服宫颈癌干细胞的耐药性和复发问题提供了有前景的解决方案，并有望显著改善宫颈癌的治疗效果。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "W4393397178", "title": "LncRNA SNHG1 Regulates the Progression of Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer by the miR-204/HOXC8 Axis", "abstract": "Hao Miao Li,1 Yong Kui Yu,1 Qi Liu,1 Xiu Feng Wei,1 Jun Zhang,1 Rui Xiang Zhang,1 Hai Bo Sun,1 Zong Fei Wang,1 Wen Qun Xing,1 Yin Li1,2 1Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China; 2Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of ChinaCorrespondence: Yin LiDepartment of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, No. 127 Dongming Road, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of ChinaTel +86-0371-65587225Email lihaomiao1989@163.comObjective: Long noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) has been reported to be aberrantly expressed and plays an important role in human cancers, including esophageal squamous cell cancer. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying SNHG1 in the progression of esophageal squamous cell cancer is poorly defined.Materials and Methods: Fifty-three esophageal squamous cell cancer patients were recruited and overall survival was analyzed. EC9706 and KYSE150 cells were cultured for study in vitro. The expression levels of SNHG1, microRNA (miR)-204 and homeobox c8 (HOXC8) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, migration and invasion were determined by flow cytometry and transwell assays, respectively. The target interaction among SNHG1, miR-204 and HOXC8 was validated by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Xenograft model was established to investigate the role of SNHG1 in vivo.Results: High expression of SNHG1 was exhibited in esophageal squamous cell cancer and indicated poor outcomes of patients. SNHG1 silence led to cell cycle arrest at G0-G1 phase, inhibition of migration and invasion and increase of apoptosis. miR-204 was validated to sponge by SNHG1 and target HOXC8 in esophageal squamous cell cancer cells. miR-204 knockdown or HOXC8 restoration reversed the inhibitive role of SNHG1 silence in the progression of esophageal squamous cell cancer cells.

Whether these variations are the consequence of nebular processes, planetary volatilization, differentiation or late accretion is still unresolved. The element mercury is the most volatile of the MVE and is a strongly chalcophile element. It is one of the few elements that exhibit large mass-dependent (MDF) and mass-independent (MIF) isotopic fractionations for both odd (odd-MIF, Δ199Hg and Δ201Hg) and even (even-MIF, Δ200Hg) Hg isotopes in nature, which is traditionally used to trace Hg biogeochemical cycling in surface environments. However, the Hg isotopic composition of Earth and meteorites is not well constrained. Here, we present Hg isotopic data for terrestrial basaltic, trachytic and granitic igneous samples. These rocks are isotopically lighter (δ202Hg = −3.3 ± 0.9‰; 1 standard deviation) than sedimentary rocks that have previously been considered to represent the terrestrial Hg isotope composition (δ202Hg=−0.7±0.5‰; 1 standard deviation). We show degassing during magma emplacement induces MIF that are consistent with kinetic fractionation in these samples. Also presented is a more complete dataset for chondritic (carbonaceous, ordinary and enstatite) meteorites, which are consistent with previous work for carbonaceous chondrites (positive odd-MIF) and ordinary chondrites (no MIF), and demonstrate that some enstatite chondrites exhibit positive odd-MIF, similar to carbonaceous chondrites. The terrestrial igneous rocks fall within the range of chondritic compositions for both MIF and MDF. Given the fact that planetary differentiation (core formation, evaporation) would contribute to Hg loss from the silicate portion of Earth and would likely fractionate Hg isotopes from chondritic compositions, we suggest that the budget of the mantle Hg is dominated by late accretion of chondritic materials to Earth, as also suggested for other volatile chalcophile elements (S, Se, Te). Considering the Hg isotopic signatures, materials with compositions similar to CO chondrites or ordinary chondrites are the most likely late accretion source candidates. Finally, eucrite meteorites, which are highly depleted in volatile elements, are isotopically heavier than chondrites and exhibit negative odd-MIF. The origin of volatile depletion in eucrites has been vigorously debated.

To further evaluate the effect of desilicification, mass fractions of elements with variable chalcophile affinities (In, Cd, Cu, Ag, S, Se, Te, Re and PGEs) in different RMs were obtained by isotope dilution and digestion procedures involving HF‐HNO 3 in bombs versus HNO 3 ‐HCl in Carius tubes. The results show that the extraction efficiencies of HF‐desilicification vary in different RMs and for different elements. HF‐desilicification led to a significant increase (30–70%) for In and Cd mass fractions in all analysed RMs, but it played a negligible role in other strongly chalcophile elements in many samples (e.g., UB‐N and WGB‐1). Noticeably, desilicification led to a 10–30% increase in the mass fractions of Cu, Ag, S, Se and Te in BHVO‐2 and BIR‐1a, but less so in BCR‐2. These results could be attributed mainly to the variable chalcophile affinities of elements and their relative budget in sulfides, alloys and silicates.

The four investigated samples from blocks hosted in the serpentinite matrix m&amp;amp;#233;lange on Syros fall into three categories: unmetasomatized eclogite (Type I, n = 1), heavily metasomatized garnet-clinopyroxene bearing rocks (Type II, n = 2), and an eclogite which hosts veins of Andr + Acm + Ep + Hem + Chl (Type III, n = 1). Type I samples of metagabbroic eclogite are characterized by a peak assemblage of Grt + Cpx + Rt with abundant clinozoisite after lawsonite. In addition to Grt + Cpx, Type II samples contain Chl + Ilm + Py + Ap &amp;amp;#177; Ep &amp;amp;#177; Cam. Clinopyroxene compositions within Type I samples display a prograde trend of increasing jadeite and decreasing acmite. In contrast, the matrix clinopyroxene in one Type II sample exhibits compositions up to 60 % acmite component. Alternatively, clinopyroxene in the second Type II sample investigated exhibit an increase in acmite component during metasomatism. Type II samples also contain epidote and hematite-rich ilmenite as opposed to clinozoisite and rutile. The association of Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-rich phases with sulfides, such as inclusions of acmitic pyroxene in pyrite, in Type II samples suggests a temporal link between sulfide deposition and oxidation of Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. In contrast, the Adr + Acm + Ep + Chl + Hem veins in the Type III sample are sulfide absent and suggest fluids with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; above the Hem-Mag and Hem-Py buffers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Garnet-epidote oxybarometry revealed elevated &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; in metasomatically altered samples. Calculations were performed using a new oxybarometry Matlab code written by the authors. Our code utilizes the latest thermodynamic database, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;A-X&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; models, and equations of state implemented in THERMOCALC. The code was also implemented in the XMapTools software package for quantitative visualization of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; using EPMA X-ray maps. Fugacity calculations were conducted at 550 &amp;amp;#176;C, 2.0 GPa, and an &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O of unity, unless otherwise stated. Oxygen fugacities for clinozoisite-garnet pairs in the Type I sample were calculated in XMapTools and fall within 0.5 log units of the quartz-fayalite-magnetite (QFM) buffer.

These garnet-epidote pairs exhibit &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of QFM+1.9 to +2.0. A minimum &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of QFM+4 calculated from the Hem-Mag buffer is estimated for Type III veins.

While elevated &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and acmite inclusions in pyrite are consistent with a SO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;(aq)-Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; redox pair in Type II samples, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; above the Hem-Mag buffer require the bulk addition of Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; or Mn&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; as a carrier of oxidation.

The olivine-rich troctolites have higher Te and Os/Ir, and lower Se/Te than MORB, which may be reconciled with a process of sulfide accumulation.

Subducting slabs are progressively depleted in volatiles and other mobile elements through dehydration and melting reactions. These elements are then introduced to the mantle wedge and volcanic arc. One consequence of this cycle is that volcanic arcs produce the most oxidized magmas on Earth. Sulfur, which exhibits a range in valence states from S2- to S6+, is one of the few elements in the subducting slab capable of oxidizing the arc and mantle wedge. Sulfides in the slab may also act as an important host of chalcophile and siderophile minor and trace elements (CSEs), such as Co, Ni, Cu, and As. The extraction of sulfur from the slab may also liberate and transfer these elements to the arc, where they may contribute to the formation of ore deposits. Such chemical and advective processes, which occur at depths in excess of 50 km, are not directly observable. Rocks and minerals in exhumed high-pressure terranes provide a chemical archive of sulfur and CSE extraction during subduction. In this dissertation, I examine the sulfur isotopic composition of sulfides in high-pressure and slab fluids, predict the concentration and speciation of sulfur in slab fluids, and characterize the CSE budget of the subducted mafic crust.\\nSulfur isotopes are a sensitive indicator of redox conditions and sulfur mobility. In situ sulfur isotope measurements were conducted using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on sulfides in high-pressure metamorphic rocks. Sulfides are classified into two categories: 1. Metamorphic sulfides, which preserve a record of prograde subduction metamorphism, and 2. Metasomatic sulfides precipitated from slab-derived fluids. The isotopic composition of metamorphic sulfides reflects their protolith compositions: −4.3 to +13.5 ‰ for metabasic rocks, and −32.4 to −11.0 ‰ for metasediments. From these data, I estimate that prograde sulfide breakdown will release slab fluids with an isotopic composition of −11 to +8 ‰. Metasomatic sulfides exhibit a range in δ34S values from −21.7 to +13.9 ‰, significantly larger than the range of predicted slab fluid compositions. The observed range of metasomatic sulfide compositions likely indicates large isotopic fractions between and oxidized slab fluid and the precipitating sulfide grains.\\nIn support of the sulfur isotope observations, I used equilibrium thermodynamic forward modeling software to predict the speciation and concentration of sulfur in slab fluids. Sulfur loss from the slab is sensitive to protolith Fe3+/SFe ratio and subduction zone thermal structure. Subduction of altered oceanic crust in cold subduction zones was found to produce significant fluxes of sulfate and sulfite species. In contrast, subduction along a warm subduction geothermal gradient produces a bi-modal release of sulfur-bearing fluids, with a low-volume shallow flux of reduced sulfur, followed by a high-volume deep flux of sulfate and sulfite species. Sulfur oxidation in these systems is balanced by ferric iron reduction. Matrix sulfides in high-pressure metamorphic rocks are rarely associated with peak metamorphic conditions, suggesting that sulfur is almost completely extracted from the slab across the blueschist to eclogite transition. The thermodynamic models predict that sulfur oxidation is balanced by iron reduction in the eclogitic slab residuum. This prediction is supported by the observation that oceanic eclogites display lower bulk rock Fe3+/SFe when compared to blueschist and altered oceanic crust.\\nPrograde sulfur-loss is anticipated to redistribute and/or release sulfide-hosted minor and trace CSEs. In situsulfide and silicate compositions were determined by laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for the elements Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, Tl, and Bi. Sulfides host nearly the entire Cu, As, Ag, Cd, and Te budget of subducted rocks. These elements are incompatible in garnet, omphacite, phengite, and rutile, and are almost completely lost from the slab during prograde sulfide breakdown. Cobalt, Ni, Zn, Ga, Ge, Mo, Sn, and Tl are hosted in silicate and oxide phases. While Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, and Pb may be partially lost during lawsonite, epidote, and amphibole dehydration reactions, Ge, Tl, Sn, and Mo are largely retained in garnet, phengite, and rutile. Mobilization of the latter elements may require high fO2 conditions or melting. Consistent with estimated CSE budgets, minor and trace element zoning in metasomatic sulfide and silicate minerals suggest that Co, Ni, and As are mobile in slab fluids. Sulfur lost from the slab is expected to oxidize the subarc mantle and arc magmas, whereas mobile CSE elements may contribute to the formation of arc-related ore deposits.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

Using structural observations, microstructural analysis, geothermometry, geobarometry, geochronology and rheological constraints from the Red Hills and Dun Mountain massifs, we propose that three deformation events occurred during the early stages of subduction initiation along the Permian margin of Gondwana. During the first deformation event, the lineated Two Tarns Harzburgite from the Red Hills formed in a transtensional setting associated with subduction initiation. Deformation was pervasive, homogeneous and simultaneous with boninitic melt migration through the unit; it also occurred at very fast strain rates (10 −9 –10 −8 s −1 ). During the second deformation event, progressive exhumation to c. 5 kbar and cooling to 1000°C led to the localization of melt and deformation into distinct zones (Dun Mountain, and the Plateau Complex, Plagioclase Zone and Ellis Stream Complex of the Red Hills). The third deformation event resulted in continued cooling and exhumation along serpentinized faults. This history provides a rare glimpse of the coupled fabric development and melt migration that sequentially develop in the early mantle wedge during the initiation of a subduction zone.", "authors": ["Emily Stewart", "J.

Over the course of Earth's history, Earth's atmospheric composition appears to have adjusted to the gradual increase in solar luminosity, resulting in persistently habitable surface temperatures. With limited exceptions, the Earth system has been observed to recover rapidly from pulsed climatic perturbations. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) regulation via negative feedbacks within the coupled global carbon‐silica cycles are classically viewed as the main processes giving rise to climate stability on Earth. Here we review the long‐term global carbon cycle budget, and how the processes modulating Earth's climate system have evolved over time. Specifically, we focus on the relative roles that shifts in carbon sources and sinks have played in driving long‐term changes in atmospheric pCO 2 . We make the case that marine processes are an important component of the canonical silicate weathering feedback, and have played a much more important role in p CO 2 regulation than traditionally imagined. Notably, geochemical evidence indicate that the weathering of marine sediments and off‐axis basalt alteration act as major carbon sinks. However, this sink was potentially dampened during Earth's early history when oceans had higher levels of dissolved silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg), and instead likely fostered more extensive carbon recycling within the ocean‐atmosphere system via reverse weathering—that in turn acted to elevate ocean‐atmosphere CO 2 levels.", "authors": ["Terry T.

However, the source of water and when it hydrated the NCC lithospheric mantle are still unclear. To address these issues, here we investigate the petrography, mineral chemistry, and the chemical and Sr‐Nd‐Pb isotopic compositions of two suites of Early Cretaceous HMAs from Western Liaoning, China, combined with new Sr‐Nd‐Pb isotopic data of the Early Cretaceous primitive basalts from the same area. Petrographic features and variations of chemical and isotopic compositions suggest a petrogenesis of mixing between mantle‐derived mafic and crust‐derived felsic melts for these HMAs and most of other Early Cretaceous HMAs in the NCC. The mantle‐derived primary melts are indicated to have been derived from the refractory lithospheric mantle beneath the NCC. Fluid‐rich melt inclusions in olivines, absence of plagioclase phenocryst, enrichments of fluid‐indicative trace elements (e.g., Rb, Ba, K, Pb, and Sr), high water content in clinopyroxenes, and low Ca in olivines indicate high water contents in the magmas and their mantle sources. The EM1‐like Sr‐Nd and unradiogenic Pb isotopic compositions of these lavas unravel a Mantle Transition Zone source for the fluids that hydrated the NCC lithospheric mantle. The wet upwelling of the Mantle Transition Zone components would be triggered by the penetration of deep‐subducted Paleo‐Pacific slab. Our study provides key evidence for the transport of water from deep Earth into the cratonic lithosphere and its role in lithospheric thinning of cratons.", "authors": ["Xianlei Geng", "Yongsheng

August 28, 2019, 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM Background: Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease, known to be affected by environmental factors with approximately 10,000 cases reported each year across mainland China. There is, however, limited evidence about the relationship between climate factors and the incidence of HFRS in China, and globally. Objective: We aimed to study the association between HFRS incidence and climate factors across China. Methods: 132,549 HFRS cases during 2006-2016 and monthly weather data from over 800 meteorological monitoring stations were obtained across all China. The study assessed relationships separately for three climate zones where most cases occur. A symmetric bi-directional case-cross over design was employed. The hazard period was defined as six calendar months preceding the month when an incident HFRS case was diagnosed, and controls were selected by two referent exposure windows symmetric to the case exposure window one year before and one year after. Air temperature and precipitation were assessed in distributed lag models (Lag 0- month of the incident case up to Lag 6 - 6 months preceding the case). Climate-zone based conditional logistic regression models were then used to examine the effect of climate variables on the risk of HFRS. Results: Estimated cumulative effect (Lag0-Lag6) of 1°C increase for HFRS incidence above thresholds showed strong association in the subtropical zone(OR-1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.18) and precipitation above thresholds for the temperate zone, warm temperate zone showed positive association with HFRS incidence and negative effects for subtropical zone, respectively. Below the threshold estimated effects (decrease of 1°C) for temperature in the temperate zone, warm temperate zone and subtropical zone were OR-1.05 95% CI 1.04-1.07, OR-1.15, 95% CI 1.13-1.17; OR-0.94 95% CI 0.91-0.96, respectively.

High-T and/or high-P garnet may contain oriented lamellae of other minerals, most commonly simple oxides (e.g., rutile, ilmenite), apatite, and, in ultrahigh-P cases, silicates including pyroxene and amphibole. Lamellae have classically been considered to be precipitation features preserving a record of former garnet chemistry richer in the lamellae nutrients (e.g., Ti4+). Such microtextural origins in precipitation systems (e.g., alloys) have long been studied via the crystallographic orientation relationships (COR) that form between a host and a separating phase, and by the shape-preferred orientation (SPO) of the lamellae. Recently, however, alternative hypotheses to precipitation have been suggested that require emplacement of lamellae in garnet by fluids, or co-growth, overgrowth, or inheritance mechanisms. These hypotheses posit that lamellae cannot be used to study former garnet chemistry. Moreover, they predict that lamellae phases, SPO, and COR should differ widely between localities, as lamellae formation will be controlled by various local rock-specific factors such as fluid presence, fluid chemistry, or mineral growth sequence. On the other hand, if lamellae characteristics are largely consistent between localities, it likely reflects control by precipitation energetics, rather than external factors. There have been few comparative COR studies in geologic systems, but the integrative assessment of COR, SPO, and lamellae assemblages should fingerprint lamellae growth process. To test the precipitation and alternative hypotheses, we collected large electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data sets for rutile, ilmenite, and apatite lamellae in garnet from the Brimfield Schist, Connecticut (≥1000 °C metamorphism; Central Maine Terrane, U.S.A.). We analyzed these data alongside published EBSD data for rutile, ilmenite, and corundum from metapegmatites metamorphosed in the eclogite facies from the Austrian Alps (Griffiths et al. 2016). The apatite data set is the first of its kind, and reveals that apatite preferentially aligns its close-packed direction parallel to that of garnet (c-axisapatite//&lt;111&gt;garnet). We also recognize a rutile-garnet COR related to those in meteorites with Widmanstätten patterns that are unequivocal products of exsolution. This is the first identification of direct similarities between silicate-oxide and metal-metal COR of which we are aware. Significantly, this rutile-garnet COR is found in diverse geologic settings including Connecticut and Idaho (U.S.A.), Austria, Germany, Greece, and China over a broad range of bulk-rock compositions. Results for all lamellae minerals show that COR are largely consistent between localities and, furthermore, are shared between apatite, ilmenite, and corundum. Moreover, between 70% and 95% of lamellae have COR and there is a dominant COR for each lamellae phase. Calculations show that d-spacing ratios of host-lamellae pairs can successfully predict the most commonly observed specific COR (those COR with two or more axial alignments with the host). These results, especially similarity of COR from markedly different geologic settings and a low diversity of lamellae minerals, are fully consistent with lamellae formation by precipitation (likely via exsolution). In contrast, the alternative hypotheses remain unsupported by COR results as well as by mineralogical and petrological evidence. Lamellae with similar traits as those in this work should thus be considered precipitates formed during unmixing of garnet compositions originally stable at elevated or extreme pressures and temperatures.", "authors": ["Duncan S.

碳酸盐熔体交代作用是指在地幔碳酸盐熔体与橄榄岩之间的相互作用,是改造地幔的重要方式之一.碳酸盐熔体交代会显著改变地幔橄榄岩的岩石学和地球化学特征.首先,碳酸盐熔体交代作用会改变地幔橄榄岩中的矿物组成和比例.尽管碳酸盐熔体与橄榄岩的反应结果受控于初始反应物成分和反应的温压条件,但多数反应会导致橄榄岩中辉石的比例增加,而且有时还会出现磷灰石、独居石等副矿物.另外,在有些受碳酸盐熔体交代显著的橄榄岩的矿物中不仅可发现大量CO2流体包裹体和碳酸盐熔体包裹体,也会出现特殊的反应边结构和熔体囊.其次,碳酸盐熔体在改造地幔橄榄岩过程中,会在地幔矿物中留下明显的地球化学指纹.在主量元素特征上,受到碳酸盐熔体交代的橄榄岩中的单斜辉石往往具有偏高的Mg#和Ca/Al比值(>5);而在微量元素组成特征上的变化更为显著,包括单斜辉石具有高的(La/Yb)N、Eu/Ti、Zr/Hf、Y/Ho比值,并显著亏损HFSE等.另外,值得注意的是,碳酸盐熔体与地幔橄榄岩反应的程度不同也会导致这些地球化学特征存在差异,因此在判别碳酸盐熔体交代作用时要采用岩石学和地球化学特征相结合,多方面对比分析.对于引起地幔碳酸盐熔体交代作用的交代介质来源的识别主要用Mg-Zn-Ca-Sr等多种同位素体系进行示踪研究,尤其是近年来微区Sr同位素分析方法的建立为地幔碳酸盐熔体交代作用研究提供了重要手段.

Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are useful molecular indicators for organic carbon (OC) source and paleoenvironment. Their application in marine environments, however, is complicated because of the mixed terrestrial and marine contributions to brGDGTs. Here, we employ two dimensional (2D) ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) to analyze brGDGTs in sediments from the Challenger Deep, Mariana Trench, the deepest ocean in the absent of terrestrial influence. The unique feature is the absence of 5-methyl brGDGTs, and the strong predominance of hexamethylated 6-methyl brGDGT (IIIa') (73.4 ±2.4 % of total brGDGTs). The brGDGTs-reconstructed pH is 8.22 ± 0.07, close to seawater pH. This, combined with characteristics of δ13C (− 19.82 ± 0.25 %), OC / TN ratio (6.72 ± 0.84), branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index (0.03 ± 0.01) and the acyclic hexa-/pentamethylated brGDGTs ratio (7.13 ± 0.98), strongly suggest that brGDGTs are of autochthonous products from benthic bacteria or planktonic bacteria. The compiling of literature data reveals that enhanced fractional abundance of hexamethylated 6-methyl brGDGTs is common in diverse continental margins when the marine influence became intensified. This may reflect an adaption of brGDGTs-producing bacteria to weak alkaline seawater and low ambient temperature. Based on the global dataset, the cross plot of acyclic hexa-/pentamethylated brGDGTs ratio and fractional abundance of brGDGT-IIIa' is an effective approach to distinguish the terrestrial vs. marine provenance of brGDGTs.", "authors": ["Wenjie Xiao", "Yasong Wang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Xi Zhang", "Linlin Shi", "Yunping Xu"], "doi": "10.5194/bg-2019-391", "url": "https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-391", "published": "2019-10-11T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": null, "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "马里亚纳海沟中六甲基化6-甲基支链甘油二烷基甘油四醚的普遍存在：来源与环境意义", "domain": "海洋地质", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "如何准确确定深海海洋环境中（尤其是在没有陆源输入的情况下）brGDGTs的来源及其环境意义？", "methodology": "使用二维超高效液相色谱-质谱（2D UHPLC-MS）分析马里亚纳海沟挑战者深渊沉积物中的支链GDGTs。", "key_findings": "马里亚纳海沟沉积物中5-甲基brGDGTs缺失，6-甲基六甲基化brGDGT (IIIa') 占主导，表明brGDGTs源于自生细菌，并适应弱碱性海水和低温。", "innovation": "提出了基于非环状六/五甲基化brGDGTs比率与brGDGT-IIIa'丰度的交叉图，作为区分brGDGTs陆源和海源的有效新方法。", "relevance_note": "本研究为利用brGDGTs准确区分海洋环境中陆源和海源有机碳，并重建古环境提供了关键工具和见解。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.5194/bg-2019-391-supplement", "title": "Supplementary material to \"Predominance of hexamethylated 6-methyl branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers in the Mariana Trench: Source and environmental implication\"", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Wenjie Xiao", "Yasong Wang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Xi Zhang", "Linlin Shi", "Yunping Xu"], "doi": "10.5194/bg-2019-391-supplement", "url": "https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-391-supplement", "published": "2019-10-11T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": null, "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "“马里亚纳海沟中六甲基化6-甲基支链甘油二烷基甘油四醚的普遍存在：来源与环境意义”的补充材料", "domain": "海洋地质", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文提供额外数据和方法，以支持主论文关于马里亚纳海沟GDGTs来源和环境意义的探究。", "methodology": "详细阐述了用于分析马里亚纳海沟沉积物中特定GDGTs的样品制备、色谱和质谱分析技术。", "key_findings": "提供了支持主论文关于六甲基化6-甲基支链GDGTs在马里亚纳海沟中占主导地位的原始数据和验证结果。", "innovation": "通过公开详细的实验步骤和数据，提高了主论文研究结果的透明度、可信度和可重复性。", "relevance_note": "对希望深入理解主论文方法学细节、验证数据或在深海GDGTs研究中应用类似技术的学者有价值。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.6084/m9.figshare.9896120", "title": "Xiao et al., raw data about brGDGTs in Mariana Trench and global environmental settings", "abstract": "This supplemetnary table contain original data on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in Mariana Trench, as welll as literature reported brGDGT data from soil, river, lake adn marine samples.", "authors": ["Wenjie Xiao", "Yasong Wang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Xi Zhang", "Linlin Shi", "Jiasong Fang"], "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.9896120", "url": "https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9896120", "published": "2019-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": null, "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "肖等人，关于马里亚纳海沟和全球环境背景下brGDGTs的原始数据", "domain": "古气候与古环境", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在提供马里亚纳海沟及全球环境背景下brGDGTs的原始数据，以供后续研究。", "methodology": "本文通过收集马里亚纳海沟的原始brGDGT数据并整合全球文献数据。", "key_findings": "核心发现是提供了一个包含马里亚纳海沟和全球多种环境brGDGTs的原始数据集。", "innovation": "创新点在于首次提供了马里亚纳海沟的原始brGDGT数据并整合了全球文献数据。", "relevance_note": "该数据集对研究brGDGTs的分布、环境指示意义及古气候重建的科学家具有重要价值。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "W3000591138", "title": "Sulfur cycling within subduction zones: Insights from exhumed mafic and ultramafic slab", "abstract": "Subduction zones significantly control the geochemical cycling and elemental transfer between the surficial andinternal reservoirs of the Earth. Amongst the most hydrophile elements sulfur is the fifth most abundant element on Earth. Subduction of oceanic lithosphere transports sulfur together with numerous other elements into Earth’s mantle and releases sulfur-bearing fluids modifying the redox state and the chemical budget of the mantle. Here, we present bulk rock sulfur geochemical data of exhumed mafic and ultramafic slab material to provide new insights into the sulfur cycle within subduction zones. Our data shows that small bodies of detached slab material are subject to metasomatic processes during exhumation (e.g., within a subduction zone channel), where fluids thatare circulating along the plate interface cause sulfur mobilization. Sulfur mobilization is thereby more pronounced within serpentinites compared to mafic rocks. In contrast, large sequences of obducted ophiolitic sections can retain their seafloor alteration signatures, particularly at moderate peak P-T conditions. Furthermore, dehydration-related vein systems in blue schists provide evidence for sulfur transfer within the subducted oceanic crust. These vein systems carry distinct sulfur isotopic signatures that reflect dehydration processes of underlying sequences suggesting a negative sulfur isotope signature of the dehydrating subducting slab.

In this regard, serpentinization systems are some of the most reducing environments found on Earth allowing for the stabilization of native metals and metal alloys and thus affecting the petrophysical properties of the oceanic lithosphere. At the Chimaera hydrothermal field in Turkey highly methaneenriched fluids issue from an ultramafic basement that is undergoing continental serpentinization, though partial serpentinization already took place during mantle exposure along an oceanic spreading center. Here, we study the sulfur geochemistry and mineralogy of selected, highly serpentinized peridotites to track sulfur sources, mobilization mechanisms of sulfur and the evolution of the redox conditions during hydrothermal alteration of these rocks – from high-temperature oceanic to low temperature continental serpentinization. Sulfur isotope compositions document seafloor alteration with introduction of Cretaceous seawater and a mostly magmatic origin of the sulfide that mainly includes pentlandite. However, sulfide and metal mineral assemblages also document fluid-rock interaction processes; awaruite and native Cu reflect highly reducing fluid conditions whereas hematite and magnetite reflect oxidizing conditions suggesting secondary formation or alteration of primary formed pentlandite during fluid-rock interaction. Sulfide minerals show distinct decomposition features with formation of native metals (mostly native Cu) providing evidence for disequilibrium conditions. Furthermore, we find strong redox gradients on the micrometer scale indicating that late stage fluid infiltration – most likely during continental serpentinization and associated with highly reducing fluids – overprinted earlier sulfide and metal mineral assemblages from oceanic serpentinization. These observations provide evidence that redox conditions strongly vary during the evolution of peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems.", "authors": ["Esther M.

However, the optimal LND cutoff point is controversial due to methodological shortcomings of previous studies, and no studies have shown the effect of LND on survival in children with WT. The purpose of this study was to remedy this situation.Methods: We identified 376 children with WT. LND cutoff point was determined using the median value, the X-tile program, the survival-tree algorithm, and the time-dependent ROC curve analysis. Survival functions were estimated by the Kaplan&ndash;Meier method. We used Cox regression analysis to determine the impact of LND on survival. Smooth curve fitting between relative mortality risk and LND was performed.Results: The LND cutoff point was 0.44, 0.65, 0.65, and 0.64 according to the median value, the X-tile program, the survival-tree algorithm, and the time-dependent ROC curve analysis, respectively. The 5-, 10-, and 20-year overall survival rates were 86.9%, 86.9%, and 84.7%, respectively, in the &lt;0.44 group and 81.3%, 80.3%, and 80.3%, respectively, in the &ge;0.44 group. Survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (P=0.185). The 5-, 10-, and 20-year overall survival rates were 87.8%, 87.8%, and 86.0%, respectively, in the &lt; 0.65 or &lt; 0.64 group and 76.5%, 75.1%, and 75.1%, respectively, in the &ge; 0.65 or &ge; 0.64 group. Children with the high LND had a significantly worse survival (P=0.011) if 0.64 or 0.65 was used for the stratification. LND was a significant predictor for overall survival in the multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR =1.797; 95% CI, 1.043&ndash;3.097; P=0.035). Smooth curve fitting suggested that the risk of mortality tended to be ascending with the increase in LND in general.Conclusion: The three methods including the X-tile program, the survival-tree algorithm, and the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis are equivalent in their ability to stratify patients and clearly better than the median method. The results showed that the optimal LND cutoff point was around 0.65 and the LND was a reliable predictor of overall survival in children with WT.

The aim of this study is to augment therapeutic efficacy of quercetin (QR) for lung cancer therapy by targeting transferrin receptors, which are overexpressed and confined to tumor cells.Methods: In this study, T7 surface-functionalized liposomes loaded with QR (T7-QR-lip) having different T7 peptide densities (0.5%, 1% and 2%) were prepared by the film hydration method. T7 surface-functionalized liposomes were characterized and evaluated in terms of in vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake, 3D tumor spheroid penetration and inhibition capabilities, in vivo biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy in mice with orthotopic lung-tumor implantation by fluorescent and bioluminescent imaging via pulmonary administration.Results: In vitro, 2% T7-QR-lip exhibited significantly augmented cytotoxicity (&amp;amp;sim;3-fold), higher apoptosis induction and S-phase cell-cycle arrest. A prominent peak right-shift and enhanced mean fluorescence intensity was observed in A549 cells treated with T7 Coumarin-6 liposomes (T7-Cou6-lip), confirming the target specificity of T7 targeted liposomes; while, after treatment with T7-QR-lip and non-targeted QR-lip, no significant difference was observed in cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity studies in MRC-5 (normal lung fibroblast) cells. T7-Cou6-lip showed higher fluorescence intensity in A549 cells and a significantly deeper penetration depth of 120 &amp;amp;mu;m in the core of the tumor spheroids and T7-QR-lip produced significantly higher tumor-spheroid growth inhibition. The in vivo biodistribution study via pulmonary delivery of T7 1,1&amp;amp;rsquo;-dioctadecyltetramethyl-indotricarbocyanine iodide liposomes demonstrated liposome accumulation in the lungs and sustained-release behavior up to 96 h.

In this study, we aimed to explore the expression pattern, prognostic potential, and functional role of miR-526b-3p in human glioma.Materials and methods: The expression of miR-526b-3p in glioma tissues and the adjacent non-tumor tissues was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The chi-square test was performed to evaluate the statistical associations between miR-526b-3p level and patient characteristics. The prognostic value of miR-526b-3p was analyzed by Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier and Cox regression analyses.

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were applied to elucidate the molecular epidemiology of the isolates.Results: In total, 60 CRE were detected in the 704 stool samples (8.5%), including 42 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Escherichia coli, 3 Citrobacter freundii, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, 3 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 1 Raoultella planticola. Fifty-five CRE isolates were positive for the carbapenemase phenotype, of which 39 were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producers.

The results showed that KIF15 promotes BC cell proliferation via the MEK -ERK pathway, and Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis revealed that KIF15 expression was an independent prognostic risk factor in BC patients. Conclusion: KIF15 may represent a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic option for BC.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of cycloserine and sought to clarify the role of cycloserine for treatment of simple MDR-TB, pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (pre-XDR-TB), and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).Materials and methods: A retrospective observational study was performed in Zhejiang Province, China. We enrolled 144 cycloserine-treated and 181 cycloserine-nontreated patients consecutively and determined the treatment outcome as the primary outcome. The proportion of patients with sputum culture conversion and the frequency of adverse drug reactions were also assessed.Results: One-hundred (69.4%) out of 144 patients in the cycloserine group successfully completed treatment. The HR of any unfavorable treatment outcome after the introduction of cycloserine was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.38&ndash;0.86, P=0.008). Subgroup analysis showed that cycloserine could benefit simple MDR-TB cases reducing the risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes (HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.24&ndash;0.76, P=0.004), but not pre-XDR-TB (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.30&ndash;1.38, P=0.263) or XDR-TB (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.22&ndash;2.37, P=0.589). The culture conversion rate at the intensive phase was similar whether cycloserine was administered or not (P=0.703). Of the 144 patients treated with cycloserine, a total of 16 (11.1%) patients experienced side effects attributed to cycloserine.Conclusion: Cycloserine is an attractive agent for the treatment of MDR-TB, and its safety profile warrants its use in most MDR-TB cases. Cycloserine significantly improved the chance of a favorable outcome for patients with simple MDR-TB but not pre-XDR-TB and XDR-TB. Thus, more aggressive regimens might be required for pre-XDR-TB or XDR-TB patients.

Methods: In this study, toxicity of T9(dR) and TP and efficient delivery of siRNA were tested in 293T, MDCK, RAW, and A549 cells. Furthermore, T9(dR)- and TP-delivered siRNAs against nucleoprotein (NP) gene segment of influenza virus (siNP) were studied in both cell lines and mice. Results: Gel retardation showed that T9(dR) effectively condensed siRNA into nanoparticles sized between 350 and 550&nbsp;nm when the mole ratio of T9(dR) to siRNA was &ge;4:1. In vitro studies demonstrated that T9(dR) successfully delivered siRNA with low cellular toxicity into several cell lines. It was also observed that T9(dR)-delivered siRNAs inhibited replication of influenza virus more efficiently as compared to that delivered by TP into the MDCK and A549 cells. It was also noticed that when given a combined tail vein injection of siNP and T9(dR) or TP, all mice in the 50 nmol siNP group infected with PR8 influenza virus survived and showed weight recovery at 2 weeks post-infection. Conclusion: This study indicates that T9(dR) is a promising siRNA delivery tool with potential application for nucleotide drug delivery.

Dysregulation of miRNAs exerts tumor-suppressing or tumor-promoting actions on the pathology and biological behaviors of NSCLC. miR-612 is associated with many types of human cancer; however, the expression, potential roles, and regulatory mechanisms of miR-612 in NSCLC remain unclear.Material and methods: Here, the expression level of miR-612 in NSCLC tissue specimens and a panel of cell lines were evaluated by RT-qPCR. Cell-Counting Kit 8, flow cytometry, Transwell migration and invasion, and in vivo tumor growth assays were performed to determine the functional role of miR-612 in malignant phenotypes of NSCLC cells. The molecular mechanism underlying the tumor-suppressive roles of miR-612 in NSCLC was investigated.Results: miR-612 was expressed at low levels in NSCLC, and low miR-612 expression was significantly correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. NSCLC patients with low miR-612 expression had shorter overall survival rate than those with high levels. Exogenous miR-612 expression decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis of NSCLC cells in vitro. miR-612 upregulation hindered NSCLC tumor growth in vivo. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-612 in NSCLC cells. BRD4 was obviously overexpressed in human NSCLC tissues and inverse correlated with miR-612 expression. Inhibition of BRD4 expression simulated the tumor-suppressive functions of miR-612 overexpression in NSCLC cells. Reintroduction of miR-612 expression abrogated the miR-612-mediated suppressive effects on NSCLC cells. BRD4 upregulation inhibited activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion: This study supports the first evidence that miR-612 exerts tumor-suppressive roles in the aggressive behaviors of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo through direct targeting BRD4 and deactivating the PI3K/Akt pathway. Thus, miR-612 might be a promising target for anticancer therapies in patients with NSCLC.Keywords: non-small-cell lung cancer, microRNA-612, bromodomain-containing protein 4, biomarker indicator", "authors": ["Xiaojiao Kang", "Feng‐Ming Kong", "Wu S", "Yongsheng Liu", "Chengcheng Yang", "Xingmao Wu", "Wenjing Zhang"], "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W4399061200", "published": "2019-05-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "microRNA-612通过直接靶向溴结构域蛋白4抑制非小细胞肺癌的恶性进展", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "The study investigates the expression, functional roles, and underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-612 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).", "methodology": "Researchers used RT-qPCR, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion assays, in vivo tumor growth models, and molecular mechanism investigations to study miR-612.", "key_findings": "miR-612 is underexpressed in NSCLC, suppresses proliferation, migration, invasion, and promotes apoptosis by directly targeting BRD4 and deactivating the PI3K/Akt pathway.", "innovation": "This study provides the first evidence that miR-612 acts as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC by directly targeting BRD4 and deactivating the PI3K/Akt pathway.", "relevance_note": "This research suggests that miR-612 could serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for non-small-cell lung cancer patients."}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1016/j.epsl.2019.03.012", "title": "Thermal-chemical conditions of the North China Mesozoic lithospheric mantle and implication for the lithospheric thinning of cratons", "abstract": "Cratons are the most ancient parts of continents that are underlain by thick, cold, old and refractory lithospheric roots. However, how cratonic roots remain stable for billions of years and become remobilized later is still not well understood. The eastern North China Craton (NCC) is the best region to illuminate this issue because of its well-known lithospheric thinning and decratonization during the Mesozoic–Cenozoic. The thinning mechanism is debated because of limited constraints on the thermal-chemical conditions (lithology and P–T–H2O–fo2) of the Archean lithospheric mantle before and during its removal. Here, we provide constraints on these thermal-chemical conditions for the Archean lithospheric mantle beneath the eastern NCC during its extensive thinning in the form of whole-rock chemical and Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic compositions and mineral (especially olivine) chemistry of the Early Cretaceous primitive basalts (MgO > 10 wt.%) from Yixian and Sihetun in the western Liaoning Province. Our data support a model in which the Yixian and Sihetun basalts were derived from metasomatized Archean lithospheric mantle under shallow (∼50–60 km), hot (∼1,290–1,350 °C) conditions. This indicates the existence of a relict (∼25 km) of the Archean lithospheric mantle during the Early Cretaceous, supporting gradual or episodic erosion of the eastern NCC lithospheric mantle. Furthermore, the NCC lithospheric mantle was not only widely rehydrated (>1,000 ppm H2O) but also highly oxidized (Δlogfo2FMQ=+1.5∼+1.9 at 1.7–2.0 GPa) during its extensive thinning. Such rehydration and oxidization are demonstrated to be closely related to wet upwelling from the Mantle Transition Zone (MTZ) triggered by the deep subduction of the Paleo-Pacific oceanic slab in the period ∼200–125 Ma. We emphasize that the water released from the upwelling MTZ component and associated hydrous melt influx played a key role in the lithospheric thinning of the eastern NCC by oxidizing the lithospheric mantle and lowering its melting point, which led to redox melting, promoting the erosion of cratonic lithosphere. Our study provides key evidence for the role of deep volatile cycling from the MTZ in modifying thermal-chemical conditions and in the lithospheric thinning of cratons.", "authors": ["Xianlei Geng", "Stephen Foley", "Yongsheng Liu", "Zaicong Wang", "Zhaochu Hu", "Lian Zhou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.epsl.2019.03.012", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2019.03.012", "published": "2019-04-03T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Earth and Planetary Science Letters", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "华北中生代岩石圈地幔的热化学条件及其对克拉通岩石圈减薄的启示", "domain": "构造地质学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "探讨克拉通岩石圈地幔的稳定与改造机制，特别是华北克拉通东部中生代岩石圈减薄的机制。", "methodology": "分析辽宁义县和四合屯早白垩世原始玄武岩的全岩化学、Sr-Nd-Pb同位素和矿物（橄榄石）化学，以约束岩石圈地幔的热化学条件。", "key_findings": "华北克拉通东部岩石圈地幔在减薄过程中广泛水化和氧化，与古太平洋洋壳深俯冲引起的MTZ湿上涌有关，水和熔体导致氧化熔融，促进了岩石圈侵蚀。", "innovation": "首次提供了地幔转换带（MTZ）深部挥发物循环在改变克拉通岩石圈热化学条件和减薄中的关键证据。", "relevance_note": "该研究为理解克拉通岩石圈地幔的改造机制和深部地球动力学过程提供了关键证据和新模型。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1016/j.epsl.2019.115971", "title": "Sulfide-bearing cumulates in deep continental arcs: The missing copper reservoir", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Kang Chen", "Ming Tang", "Cin‐Ty A.

The significant range of δ 65 Cu in mantle peridotites thus could be ascribed to recycled crustal materials and/or oxidative mantle metasomatism. However, the influence of normal magmatic fractionation processes on δ 65 Cu variations remains poorly understood, and it is unclear whether the magmatic processes also lead to large δ 65 Cu variations in mantle rocks. To address the issue, we present bulk‐rock δ 65 Cu of fresh mantle pyroxenites from the Balmuccia peridotite massif, Northern Italy. These pyroxenites formed by melt‐peridotite reaction and mineral accumulation from MORB‐ to OIB‐like, sulfide‐saturated basic magmas. Mass balance calculations show that sulfide phases host &gt;98 wt % of the Cu budget of bulk rocks (87−484 μg/g). The pyroxenites show significant variations of δ 65 Cu from −0.66‰ to 0.66‰, which cover the range known for peridotites, including metasomatized ones. Three subsamples from the same pyroxenite layer display &gt;0.3‰ decrease in δ 65 Cu with progressive differentiation. Nevertheless, δ 65 Cu does not display correlations with indicators of magmatic differentiation (e.g., Mg# and Cu/Pd) for all pyroxenites in this study. This might be attributed to variable extents of magmatic sulfide segregation for different samples and/or varying δ 65 Cu of the pyroxenite parent magmas, which were also affected by reactive migration through peridotites.

In particular, when a decompaction weakening mechanism is introduced to account for the rock viscosity reduction due to fluid overpressures, channeling instabilities evolve into high‐porosity/permeability fluid conduits that focus mass and energy transfer. In this study, we consider a crustal rheology that accounts simultaneously for upward‐increasing viscosity and decompaction weakening to examine the nucleation and evolution of fluid channelization in two dimensions (2‐D). The model shows that plume‐shaped flow patterns can develop on time scales as short as 10 4 years, during which the plume tails act as fluid conduits and the plume heads act as fluid dispersion zones near the brittle‐ductile transition. Collection of fluids into conduits is accomplished by a basal fluid catchment zone characterized by strong lateral fluid pressure gradients but low porosity/permeability. Relatively narrow ranges of viscous activation energy (∼100 kJ mol −1 ) and decompaction weakening factor (∼10 −4 ) are constrained if the fluid conduits are of kilometer scale in width. Significant thermal excursions (∼65 °C) can be induced if a high flow rate, potentially from rapid intermittent dehydration, is realized within channels. Moreover, if the focused fluids emanate from external anomalously hot sources (e.g., magma intrusion), thermal pulses (&gt;100°C), and steep lateral temperature gradients (&gt;50°C km −1 ) can be generated. Given the focusing efficiency estimated from our 2‐D compaction model, simple 3‐D modeling further shows that tubular conduits have the potential to cause thermal pulses &gt;200°C within 10 4 years.", "authors": ["Meng Tian", "Jay J.

Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is one of the most popular techniques for U-Pb geochronologic analysis. Currently, the significant matrix effects observed between different accessory minerals and the lack of high-quality standards for many minerals of interest are the major limitations of its geochronological applications. In this study, we investigated the effects of the addition of oxygen, nitrogen, and water vapor before and after the ablation cell on the accuracy of the U-Pb dating of different minerals (e.g., zircon, monazite, titanite, and xenotime) by LA-ICP-MS. We found that the addition of water vapor, unlike that of oxygen and nitrogen, before the ablation cell can significantly suppress the matrix effects on U-Pb dating. The deviations of the measured <sup>206</sup>Pb/<sup>238</sup>U ratios in these accessory minerals were significantly reduced from 10 to 24% to less than 1-2% when using NIST 610 glass as an external standard. This can be attributed to the suppression of elemental fractionation in both the laser ablation and ICP ionization processes by the presence of water vapor. The developed water vapor-assisted LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating method has been successfully applied to the analysis of zircon, monazite, xenotime, and titanite with NIST 610 glass as a reference material in both the 193 nm excimer laser and 213 nm Nd:YAG laser ablation systems.", "authors": ["Tao Luo", "Zhaochu Hu", "Wen Zhang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Keqing Zong", "Lian Zhou", "Junfeng Zhang", "Shenghong Hu"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01231", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01231", "published": "2018-07-10T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Analytical Chemistry", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "水蒸气辅助的“通用”非基体匹配分析方法，用于采用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离子体质谱法对锆石、独居石、榍石和磷钇矿进行原位 U–Pb 定年", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在解决LA-ICPMS U-Pb测年中不同副矿物间的基质效应和缺乏高质量通用标准的问题。", "methodology": "研究通过在激光烧蚀池前后添加氧气、氮气和水蒸气，考察其对LA-ICPMS U-Pb测年准确性的影响。", "key_findings": "发现水蒸气在烧蚀池前加入能显著抑制基质效应和元素分馏，将206Pb/238U比值偏差从10-24%降至1-2%以下。", "innovation": "创新点在于开发了一种水蒸气辅助的LA-ICPMS U-Pb测年方法，实现了非基质匹配的“通用”分析。", "relevance_note": "该研究为地质年代学领域提供了一种使用单一通用标准（NIST 610玻璃）对多种矿物进行准确U-Pb测年的新途径。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1029/2017gc007284", "title": "Olivine Oxygen Isotope Evidence for Intracontinental Recycling of Delaminated Continental Crust", "abstract": "Abstract This paper reports the oxygen isotope compositions of olivine from dunite, wehrlite, harzburgite, and lherzolite xenoliths entrained by the Early Cretaceous high‐Mg diorites and Late Cretaceous basalts in the central and eastern North China Craton, with the aim of constraining processes that happened in the lithospheric mantle. Olivine oxygen isotope compositions were analyzed in situ using secondary ion mass spectrometry. Olivine δ 18 O of harzburgite and lherzolite xenoliths hosted in the Fushan and Tietonggou diorites with Archean and Paleoproterozoic rhenium‐depletion model ages ranges from 5.1‰ to 5.8‰, similar to olivine from spinel lherzolite xenoliths in the Late Cretaceous Fuxin basalts (olivine δ 18 O = 5.2–5.4‰) and typical mantle olivine. In contrast, olivine δ 18 O from dunite and wehrlite xenoliths ranges from 6.1‰ to 7.7‰, significantly higher than the typical mantle values. The olivine oxygen isotope data, combined with the petrologic observations, mineral compositions, and whole‐rock trace element and Sr‐Nd‐Os isotope compositions of the peridotite, suggest that the peridotites in Early Cretaceous high‐Mg diorites had been affected by interaction with melt derived from delaminated continental crust.

Here we present an integrated mineralogical, geochemical, and geochronological study of the Wuwamen ophiolitic mélange in the South Tianshan to better understand the tectonic evolution of the western CAOB and its links to Gondwana and Pangea. Mantle peridotites with mineral compositions similar to those of abyssal peridotites and basalts with N‐MORB geochemical affinities suggest that the Wuwamen ophiolite was formed in a mid‐ocean ridge setting. Arc‐related gabbro and plagiogranite stocks intruding the mantle peridotites yielded zircon U–Pb ages of 441.1 ± 4.2 and 442.8 ± 2.4 Ma, indicating that the Wuwamen ophiolite got emplaced prior to ~440 Ma.

A comprehensive study of field observations with whole-rock and in situ mineral chemical and isotopic compositions was carried out on granitoids, mafic microgranular enclaves (MME) and country-rock xenoliths (CRX) from Tonglu, South China to constrain the magmatic processes operating. Zircon U–Pb geochronology indicates that the MME and granitoids formed coevally at ∼130 Ma. Petrographic observations suggest that the MME are quenched mafic clots formed during incomplete magma mixing. The different zircon Hf isotopic compositions of the MME (εHf(t) = -4·0 to -0·7) and the host granitoids (εHf(t) = -8·1 to -1·7) indicate mingling between mafic and felsic magmas from different sources. The CRX are composed of fresh cores and dark rims. The pyroxene-rich fresh cores are depleted in Rb, Ba and K while the biotite-rich dark rims show obvious enrichments in Rb, Ba and K, indicating modification by hydrous K-rich felsic melts or fluids from the host magma. In contrast, some large CRX have embayed structures and are surrounded by several small, biotite-rich CRX, suggesting disaggregation and modification of large CRX into the host magma. The occurrence of abundant felsic magmatic veinlets in the CRX implies that they could have experienced brittle deformation in the cold shallow crust, which agrees with an emplacement depth of about 5 km estimated using Al-in hornblende geobarometry. The high 87Sr/86Sri (0·7129) and low εNd(t) (-10·2) values imply that these CRX were derived from the upper continental crust. All these features suggest a typical reactive bulk assimilation process. Microanalysis of 87Sr/86Sr ratios in plagioclase from the Tonglu granitoids vary over a large range (0·7073–0·7137) with complex rim-core-rim variations, which resulted from open-system processes. Given the variation in Sr isotopes, four types of plagioclase were identified. Type I plagioclase are homogeneous in terms of 87Sr/86Sr, suggesting normal crystal fractionation. Recharge of mafic magma injecting into felsic magma resulted in the core–mantle variations of type II plagioclases. Albitic cores with high 87Sr/86Sr (up to 0·7092) indicate felsic magma with highly radiogenic Sr (87Sr/86Sr > 0·7092). Influx of mafic magma with less radiogenic Sr (87Sr/86Sr < 0·7080) resulted in a decrease in 87Sr/86Sr and an abrupt increase of An contents (∼An30 to ∼An60) from core to mantle. Type III plagioclase are distinguished by lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the core (0·7084–0·.7086) and significantly more radiogenic Sr at the rim (0·7097–0·7112), which is attributed to the assimilation of the country rocks. Core-mantle-rim variations in type IV plagioclase not only record magma recharge events, but also crustal assimilation. Increasing An values and decreasing 87Sr/86Sr ratios (down to 0·7075) from core to mantle and significantly more radiogenic Sr (up to 0·7117) in the outer rim suggest that the recharge event took place prior to the assimilation of ancient crustal components. Recharge of hot mafic magma into a pre-existing magma chamber will not only increase the temperature of the magma in the chamber, but may also induce intense shattering of the brittle country-rocks, both of which could have enhanced the process of reactive bulk assimilation.", "authors": ["Kaizhang Yu", "Yongsheng Liu", "Qinghai Hu", "Mihai N.

Based on the spatial coincidence of a thermal anomaly and contours of depressed δ18O values centered on networks of quartz–graphite and pegmatitic veins in the vicinity of Bristol, NH, it was proposed in an earlier study that large-scale ascending hot fluid focused through a vein network drove heating and introduced isotopically distinct fluids. The thermal anomaly could be preserved only if the timescales of heating were extremely short, otherwise conduction would smooth the field temperature gradient. Herein, we conduct a petrological test to estimate the peak temperatures and the durations of metamorphism across the Bristol region, using pseudosection analysis as well as forward modeling of garnet growth–diffusion–resorption profiles. This region attained granulite-facies conditions in the sillimanite–K-feldspar–cordierite zone over a larger area than previously mapped. Cordierite is variably present, which reflects bulk compositional controls on its stability as well as its destruction during retrogression. The forward modeling reveals protracted (5–8 Myr) granulite-facies conditions of 0·5–0·6 GPa and ∼750–820°C, and an overall counterclockwise P–T path. Furthermore, a short-lived thermal anomaly or 'spike' (>100°C, ∼0·15 Myr) is superimposed on the granulite-facies core, reaching ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) conditions >900°C, much higher than previously recognized in the area. The short timescale is fully consistent with the localized radius of the thermal anomaly of ∼1·5 km. Subsequently, the area underwent variably developed amphibolite-facies retrogression at ∼650°C and 0·4–0·5 GPa, accompanied by fluid infiltration, garnet breakdown, and muscovite growth. The transient thermal spike and the counterclockwise P–T path indicate that heat transfer could not have been solely the result of internal heating of overthickened crust. We posit that external heat fluxes driven by Acadian plutonism, in addition to heat generation in crust enriched in heat-producing elements, led to the granulite-facies metamorphism. Magmatic loading in the crust, potentially in response to an elevated basal heat flux during the Acadian orogeny, can account for the counterclockwise P–T path. Heat transported advectively by channelized flow of magma or magma evolving hydrothermal fluids is the most likely cause of the transient and local UHT thermal anomaly. The results show that UHT metamorphic events can be extremely brief.", "authors": ["Xu Chu", "Jay J. Ague", "Meng Tian", "Ethan F. Baxter", "D. Rumble", "C.

However, proper tectonic driver remains elusive to reconcile the broad intracontinental magmatic province. This study presents integrated zircon U–Pb dating, Hf isotopes and whole‐rock geochemistry of the Xiwan dioritic porphyry in the NE Jiangxi ophiolitic mélange. Zircon U–Pb dating by SIMS and LA‐ICP‐MS methods yielded an emplacement age of ∼160 Ma for the Xiwan diorite, confirming its inclusion into the Mesozoic magmatic province in SE China, instead of a component of the Neoproterozoic ophiolitic mélange genetically. The dioritic rocks have low SiO 2 (58.08wt%–59.15wt%), and high Na 2 O (5.00wt%–5.21wt%) and MgO (4.60wt%–5.24wt%) contents with low TFeO/MgO ratios (1.02–1.09). They show an adakitic geochemical affinity but exhibit relatively low Sr/Y ratios (24.8–31.1) and high Y contents (14.6–18.3 ppm) compared to the Dexing adakitic porphyries. In addition, the Xiwan diorites have moderately evolved zircon Hf isotopic compositions (ε Hf ( t )=−6.1‐ −0.1; T DM2 =1597–1219 Ma). These elemental and isotopic signatures suggest that the Xiwan diorite formed through partial melting of a remnant arc lower crust (i.e., early Neoproterozoic mafic arc‐related rocks) in response to the underplating of coeval mafic magmas. In conjunction with the temporal‐spatial distribution and complex geochemical characteristics of the Mesozoic magmatism, our case study attests to the feasibility of a flat‐slab subduction model in developing the broad intracontinental magmatic province in SE China.

The positive correlation between the measured β Sm and β Nd ( r 2 = 0.9981) over this time in our laboratory demonstrates the excellent long‐term stability of the method. Compared with the normal method, Sm and Nd signal intensities were improved by a factor of 2.9 with the use of X skimmer and Jet sample cones in combination with the addition of nitrogen at 3–6 ml min −1 to the central gas flow. The enhancement of signal intensity benefits the accurate in situ determination of the Sm‐Nd isotopes of samples poor in these elements. 143 Nd/ 144 Nd values were also determined in two manganese nodules and GSMC Co‐rich crust with low mass fractions of Nd (94–293 μg g −1 ). Generally, most of the obtained Sm‐Nd isotopic compositions in these geological materials are consistent with published values. ‘External reproducibility’ (2 s ) of 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 147 Sm/ 144 Nd was typically better than 0.06‰ and 2.5‰, respectively, demonstrating that the Durango, Otter Lake, NW ‐1 and MAD apatites, the Khan, and OLT ‐1 titanites, MGMH #117531 monazite and LV 01 eudialyte are promising candidate reference materials for in situ Sm‐Nd isotopic determinations. The Trebilcock, Mae Klang and 44069 monazites are only suitable for in situ Nd isotopic determinations because of their heterogeneous Sm/Nd compositions. The heterogeneous Sm‐Nd composition of titanite BLR ‐1 demonstrates that it is not a suitable reference material for in situ Sm‐Nd isotopic determinations. Deep‐sea samples ( NOD ‐A‐1 and NOD ‐P‐1 manganese nodule, GSMC Co‐rich crust) with low mass fractions of Nd also show homogenous Nd isotopic compositions.

The rocks lie within the Acadian-Neoacadian orogenic belt (Devonian) and form part of the Brimfield Schist. The Brimfield and the adjacent Bigelow Brook Formation contain silica-saturated rocks that have previously been shown to have undergone ~1000 °C metamorphism. The pressure was less well constrained at ≥ ~1 GPa. Silica-undersaturated rocks hold underutilized potential for pinpointing peak metamorphic conditions, particularly pressure, because of their resilience to melting and the variety of refractory minerals they contain. The typical silica-undersaturated mineral assemblage is garnet + spinel + corundum + plagioclase + K-feldspar + biotite + ilmenite. Leucosomes are syenites consisting of two feldspars ± biotite. Plagioclase is commonly antiperthitic, particularly in feldspathic domains surrounding peritectic garnet; such garnet crystals reach ~10 cm in diameter. Alkali feldspars are perthitic. The rocks contain remarkable ellipsoidal spinels as much as 5.5 cm long comprising discrete crystallographic domains hosting crystallographically oriented lamellae of a Fe-Ti phase, most likely ilmenite. Corundum is usually colorless, but can also be found as sapphire in shades of pink, purple, and blue, particularly in antiperthite-rich domains surrounding large garnets. Some sapphires are concentrically color zoned. We carried out a P-T estimation using ternary feldspar reintegration thermometry of metamorphic antiperthites together with pseudosection modeling. Samples texturally and chemically record near-eclogite facies equilibration at minimum conditions of ~1040 °C and ~1.8 GPa, establishing the CMT in northeastern CT as the first known HPG locality in the U.S. These results are consistent with high P2O5 levels found in garnet (0.18 wt%), Ti-in-biotite thermometry, regional sillimanite pseudomorphs after kyanite, and preliminary experimental work on melt inclusions in garnet (Ferrero et al. 2017). The leucosomes provide strong evidence that partial melting of silica-undersaturated rocks at HPG conditions can produce syenitic magmata. Strongly melt-depleted silica-undersaturated rocks may also be protoliths for garnet + spinel + corundum xenoliths reported from kimberlites. The presence of HPG gneisses demonstrates that the large-scale thrusts of the CMT sample the deepest roots of the orogenic belt (60–70 km), and perhaps even deeper subduction zone lithologies as well.", "authors": ["Duncan S.

RTS games provide partially observable gaming environments, where agents interact with one another in an action space much larger than that of GO. Mastering RTS games requires both strong macro strategies and delicate micro level execution. Recently, great progress has been made in micro level execution, while complete solutions for macro strategies are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based Hierarchical Macro Strategy model for mastering MOBA games, a sub-genre of RTS games. Trained by the Hierarchical Macro Strategy model, agents explicitly make macro strategy decisions and further guide their micro level execution.

Patients were divided into a low LND group and high LND group. Survival curves based on the LND stratification were plotted using the Kaplan&ndash;Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The impact of prognostic factors on overall survival was analyzed using Cox regression models.Results: A total of 1,924 patients were identified from the database. Overall survival for the low LND group at 5, 10, and 20 years was significantly better than the high LND group (5-year survival: 94.1% vs 81.4%; 10-year survival: 92.6% vs 80.8%; 20-year survival: 90.6% vs 79.1%; P&lt;0.001). In multivariate analysis, LND was a significant predictor of overall survival, regardless of whether it was a categorical variable or a continuous variable. Other significant predictors included age, race, SEER stage, and tumor laterality.Conclusion: LND was a significant risk factor for overall survival of patients with WT.

In this study, we aim to elucidate the role of miR-1269 in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Methods and results: From the results of analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we noted the expression of miR-1269 was increased in lung cancer tissue. miR-1269 expression was detected in both the normal adjacent lung tissue and in the tumorous lung tissue of lung cancer patients, and miR-1269 was more highly expressed in the tumors. High expression of miR-1269 correlated with patients&amp;rsquo; tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) analysis and a cloning formation assay showed that overexpression of miR-1269 significantly promoted the growth of A549 cells, and that a lower expression of miR-1269 significantly increased cell apoptosis. We used the TargetScan 6.2 Database to predict the potential targets of miR-1269, and a luciferase activity assay was used to determine the direct interaction between miR-1269, tumor protein p53 (TP53), and caspase-9. Results from Western blots and real-time PCR showed that overexpression of miR-1269 significantly inhibited TP53 and caspase-9 expression. In addition, caspase-3 activity was found to decrease in a miR-1269 mimic group. The results showed that gene silencing of TP53 and caspase-9 significantly inhibited A549 cell growth and promoted cell apoptosis. The results also showed that the inhibition of miR-1269 and caspase-9 expression inhibited cell apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results demonstrated that TP53 and caspase-9 were expressed in low levels in tumor tissues, and that an inverse correlation exists between&amp;nbsp;miR-1269&amp;nbsp;expression&amp;nbsp;levels&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;TP53 or caspase-9 expression levels.

Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chronic migraine (CM). Clinical observations also show that nicotine gum induces analgesic effects in migraine patients. However, whether &alpha;7nAChR is involved in CM is unclear.Objective: To investigate the role of &alpha;7nAChR in CM and provide a new therapeutic target for CM.Materials and methods: Thirty-six male Sprague&ndash;Dawley rats were distributed randomly into control, CM, PNU-282987, and &alpha;-bungarotoxin groups (n=9 rats in each group). The CM model was established by the recurrent daily administration of inflammatory soup on the dura over the course of 1 week. The hind paw threshold and facial allodynia were assessed by the von Frey test. The expression levels of &alpha;7nAChR, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta were analyzed by Western blot and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The location of &alpha;7nAChR in the hippocampus was quantified by immunofluorescence, as well as the microglial and astrocyte alterations. Changes in the calcitonin gene-related peptide and the phosphorylated JNK protein among different groups were measured by Western blot.Results: We found that the expression of &alpha;7nAChR was reduced after repeated inflammatory soup administration. The increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and calcitonin gene-related peptide in CM group were significantly decreased by PNU-282987 and aggravated by &alpha;-bungarotoxin. Moreover, PNU-282987 decreased the numbers of astrocytes and microglia compared with the numbers in the CM group in both hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. In contrast, &alpha;-bungarotoxin activated the astrocytes and microglia, but the differences with respect to the CM group were not significant. Activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling was observed in CM rats and was also blocked by PNU-282987.Conclusion: The activation of &alpha;7nAChR increased the mechanical threshold and alleviated pain in the CM rat model. &alpha;7nAChR activation also decreased the upregulation of astrocytes and microglia through the p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase&ndash;mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.

However, their functions in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been identified. The aim of this study was to analyze the putative signaling pathway encompassing DJ-1, PI3K, and HIF-1&amp;alpha; in a series of CRC tissues and cell lines.Purpose: This study aimed at exploring the expression status of DJ-1 in colon cancer and its role in survival of cancer cell lines.Methods: The expression and localization of DJ-1, PI3K-p110&amp;alpha;, phosphorylated Akt (p-AKT), and HIF-1&amp;alpha; were determined by immunohistochemistry in 73 resected CRC tissues. The effect of DJ-1 on cell activity was explored by in vitro knockdown and overexpression experiments in SW480 and HT-29 cells. The cells were treated with a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002 or wortmannin), and p-AKT and HIF-1&amp;alpha; protein expression were then analyzed. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of several HIF-1 target genes were assessed under hypoxic conditions by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot. Xenograft tumor growth studies were conducted in DJ-1 knockdown or overexpression cells.Results: High DJ-1 expression was found in 68.49% (50/73) of CRC tissues and associated with larger tumor size and advanced clinical stages. DJ-1 expression was positively associated with PI3K-p110&amp;alpha;, p-AKT, and HIF-1&amp;alpha; expression in CRC. HIF-1&amp;alpha; and p-AKT protein levels were lower in SW480 and HT-29 cells with stable DJ-1 knockdown than in those with DJ-1 overexpression. PI3K inhibitors almost completely blocked DJ-1-induced AKT phosphorylation. However, the expression of HIF-1&amp;alpha; was partially preserved after treatment with PI3K inhibitors. We also show that DJ-1 is necessary for the transcriptional ability of HIF-1&amp;alpha; and CRC cell survival after hypoxic stress. Moreover, DJ-1 promoted the growth of established tumor xenografts in nude mice.Conclusion: Our findings are the first to show that DJ-1 is overexpressed in CRC. We suggest a model in which DJ-1 mediates CRC cell survival by regulating the PI3K-AKT-HIF-1&amp;alpha; pathway.

by diffusing (Nd, Pr)H<sub><i>x</i></sub>", "abstract": "The grain boundary diffusion process (GBDP) is effective to enhance coercivity of the single-main-phase (SMP) RE2Fe14B (rare earth (RE)) magnets through forming magnetic hardening shells surrounding the hard grain cores. Here, the GBDP was applied to the multi-main-phase (MMP) (Nd, Pr)22.3Ce8.24FebalM1.0B1.0 (wt.%) magnets prepared by sintering the mixture of Ce-free and Ce-containing 2:14:1 powders, which have shown superior magnetic properties, especially coercivity, to the SMP ones at the same average composition. The remanence of the (Nd, Pr)H x diffused magnets increases gradually with the increase of diffusion temperature from 480 to 880 °C, the coercivity, however, slightly decreases. The highest (BH)max of 350.1 kJ m−3 is achieved when diffusing at 680 °C, which is 9.2% higher than 320.7 kJ m−3 for the as-prepared magnet. The remanence increment is due to the diffusion of Nd/Pr into the 2:14:1 phase grains, enlarging the intrinsic saturation magnetic polarization. The slight coercivity reduction is due to the gradual homogenization of RE distribution within the 2:14:1 grains of the undiffused parts, i.e. approaching the 'close to equilibrium (or SMP)' state, which offsets the positive contributions from the enrichment of Nd/Pr in the Ce-rich 2:14:1 phase and the formation of continuous RE-rich intergranular phase. These findings suggest that the GBDP effect on coercivity of the MMP Nd–Ce–Fe–B magnets is distinctly different from the SMP ones, and that the chemical heterogeneity should be carefully controlled to improve the magnetic properties of such high cost-performance permanent magnets.", "authors": ["Tianyu Ma", "Wenying Zhang", "Baixing Peng", "Yongsheng Liu", "Yongjie Chen", "Xinhua Wang", "Mi Yan"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6463/aaa205", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/aaa205", "published": "2017-12-15T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Physics D Applied Physics", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "通过扩散(Nd, Pr)H<sub><i>x</i></sub>改变多主相Nd–Ce–Fe–B磁体的磁性能", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在探究晶界扩散工艺（GBDP）对多主相（MMP）Nd-Ce-Fe-B磁体磁性能的影响。", "methodology": "采用(Nd, Pr)Hx作为扩散源，通过烧结Ce-free和Ce-containing 2:14:1粉末制备多主相磁体，并进行不同温度的晶界扩散处理。", "key_findings": "扩散后磁体的剩磁随温度升高而增加，矫顽力略有下降；在680°C扩散时，(BH)max达到350.1 kJ m−3，比原始磁体提高9.2%。", "innovation": "发现GBDP对多主相Nd-Ce-Fe-B磁体矫顽力的影响与单主相磁体显著不同，揭示了其独特的磁性能演变机制。", "relevance_note": "该研究强调了精确控制化学异质性对于提升高性价比永磁体磁性能的重要性，为相关领域研究者提供了新思路。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1144/jgs2017-010", "title": "Initiation and duration of Grampian orogenesis constrained by refined Sm–Nd garnet geochronology of the Ballantrae ophiolite, Scotland", "abstract": "We report the results of Sm–Nd garnet geochronology on a mafic granulite from the metamorphic sole of the Ballantrae Ophiolite, Scotland.

Thermodynamic modelling indicates peak conditions of c . 825°C and at least 10 kbar for the unit. In conjunction with a biostratigraphic constraint on metamorphic garnet deposition in sediments at 465 ± 2.5 Ma, this new age more precisely constrains the duration of Grampian metamorphism in Scotland to 12.6 ± 3.1 myr (2σ). In combination with this new age, previous geochronological work on sillimanite-zone garnet indicates a time-averaged initial heating rate of 106 ± 78°C myr −1 (2σ), a rapid rate that may be inconsistent with orogenic self-heating via crustal overthickening alone. The calculated heating rate for the associated garnet zone is also rapid and more precisely constrained at 47 ± 14°C myr −1 (2σ).

Use of seabed drills enabled collection of more than 57 m of core, with borehole penetration ranging from 1.30 to 16.44 meters below seafloor and core recoveries as high as 74.76% of total penetration. This high level of recovery of shallow mantle sequences is unprecedented in the history of ocean drilling. The cores recovered along the southern wall of Atlantis Massif have highly heterogeneous lithologies, types of alteration, and degrees of deformation. The ultramafic rocks are dominated by harzburgites with intervals of dunite and minor pyroxenite veins, as well as gabbroic rocks occurring as melt impregnations and veins, all of which provide information about early magmatic processes and the magmatic evolution in the southernmost portion of Atlantis Massif. Dolerite dikes and basaltic rocks represent the latest stage of magmatic activity. Overall, the ultramafic rocks recovered during Expedition 357 reveal a high degree of serpentinization, as well as metasomatic talc-amphibole-chlorite overprinting and local rodingitization. Metasomatism postdates an early phase of serpentinization but predates late-stage intrusion and alteration of dolerite dikes and the extrusion of basalt. The intensity of alteration is generally lower in the gabbroic and doleritic rocks. Chilled margins in dolerite intruded into talc-amphibole-chlorite schists are observed at the most eastern Site M0075. Deformation in Expedition 357 cores is variable and dominated by brecciation and formation of localized shear zones; the degree of carbonate veining was lower than anticipated. All types of variably altered and deformed ultramafic and mafic rocks occur as components in sedimentary breccias and as fault scarp rubble. The sedimentary cap rocks include basaltic breccias with a carbonate sand matrix and/or fossiliferous carbonate. Fresh glass on basaltic components was observed in some of the breccias.&#13;\\n &#13;\\n The expedition also successfully applied new technologies, namely (1) extensively using an in situ sensor package and water sampling system on the seabed drills for evaluating real-time dissolved oxygen and methane, pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), temperature, and conductivity during drilling; (2) deploying a borehole plug system for sealing seabed drill boreholes at four sites to allow access for future sampling; and (3) proving that tracers can be delivered into drilling fluids when using seabed drills. The rock drill sensor packages and water sampling enabled detection of elevated dissolved methane and hydrogen concentrations during and/or after drilling, with “hot spots” of hydrogen observed over Sites M0068–M0072 and methane over Sites M0070–M0072. Shipboard determination of contamination tracer delivery confirmed appropriate sample handling procedures for microbiological and geochemical analyses, which will aid all subsequent microbiological investigations that are part of the science party sampling plans and will verify this new tracer delivery technology for seabed drill rigs. Shipboard investigation of biomass density in select samples revealed relatively low and variable cell densities, and enrichment experiments set up shipboard reveal growth. Thus, we anticipate achieving many of the deep biosphere–related objectives of the expedition through continued scientific investigation in the coming years.&#13;\\n &#13;\\n Finally, although not an objective of the expedition, we were serendipitously able to generate a high-resolution (20 m per pixel) multibeam bathymetry map across the entire Atlantis Massif and the nearby fracture zone, MAR, and eastern conjugate, taking advantage of weather and operational downtime.

The primary goals of this expedition were to (1) examine the role of serpentinization in driving hydrothermal systems, sustaining microbial communities, and sequestering carbon; (2) characterize the tectonomagmatic processes that lead to lithospheric heterogeneities and detachment faulting; and (3) assess how abiotic and biotic processes change with variations in rock type and progressive exposure on the seafloor. To accomplish these objectives, we developed a coring and sampling strategy centered on the use of seabed drills—the first time that such systems have been used in the scientific ocean drilling programs. This technology was chosen in the hope of achieving high recovery of the carbonate cap sequences and intact contact and deformation relationships. The expedition plans also included several engineering developments to assess geochemical parameters during drilling; sample bottom water before, during, and after drilling; supply synthetic tracers during drilling for contamination assessment; acquire in situ electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements for assessing fractures, fluid flow, and extent of serpentinization; and seal boreholes to provide opportunities for future experiments.&#13;\\n &#13;\\n Seventeen holes were drilled at nine sites across Atlantis Massif, with two sites on the eastern end of the southern wall (Sites M0068 and M0075), three sites in the central section of the southern wall north of the Lost City hydrothermal field (Sites M0069, M0072, and M0076), two sites on the western end (Sites M0071 and M0073), and two sites north of the southern wall in the direction of the central dome of the massif and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1309 (Sites M0070 and M0074). Use of seabed drills enabled collection of more than 57 m of core, with borehole penetration ranging from 1.30 to 16.44 meters below seafloor and core recoveries as high as 74.76% of total penetration. This high level of recovery of shallow mantle sequences is unprecedented in the history of ocean drilling. The cores recovered along the southern wall of Atlantis Massif have highly heterogeneous lithologies, types of alteration, and degrees of deformation. The ultramafic rocks are dominated by harzburgites with intervals of dunite and minor pyroxenite veins, as well as gabbroic rocks occurring as melt impregnations and veins, all of which provide information about early magmatic processes and the magmatic evolution in the southernmost portion of Atlantis Massif. Dolerite dikes and basaltic rocks represent the latest stage of magmatic activity. Overall, the ultramafic rocks recovered during Expedition 357 reveal a high degree of serpentinization, as well as metasomatic talc-amphibole-chlorite overprinting and local rodingitization. Metasomatism postdates an early phase of serpentinization but predates late-stage intrusion and alteration of dolerite dikes and the extrusion of basalt. The intensity of alteration is generally lower in the gabbroic and doleritic rocks. Chilled margins in dolerite intruded into talc-amphibole-chlorite schists are observed at the most eastern Site M0075. Deformation in Expedition 357 cores is variable and dominated by brecciation and formation of localized shear zones; the degree of carbonate veining was lower than anticipated. All types of variably altered and deformed ultramafic and mafic rocks occur as components in sedimentary breccias and as fault scarp rubble. The sedimentary cap rocks include basaltic breccias with a carbonate sand matrix and/or fossiliferous carbonate.

Recently, the incidence of ovarian cancer has been increasing annually, and there remains a lack of suitable treatment methods that can significantly improve the 5-year survival rates of patients. Therefore, it is necessary to identify more effective treatments for ovarian cancer. It is established that microRNAs (miRNAs) have important roles in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer and a specific miRNA, miR-762, can promote the development of a variety of tumors. Menin is encoded by MEN1, a tumor suppressor gene, that is usually downregulated in ovarian cancer. In this study, we evaluated the expression levels of miR-762 and menin in ovarian cancer tissues and demonstrated that they were correlated.

About 90% of oral cancer is of squamous cell carcinoma type. Surgery and radiation with and without chemotherapy are the major treatments for oral cancer. Better advanced treatment is still needed. Multidrug resistance plays an important role in failure of oral cancer chemotherapy. In this study, we tried to fabricate a novel nanoparticle that could carry both MDR1-siRNA to block MDR1 expression and doxorubicin (DOX), a chemotherapy drug, into cancer cells in order to directly kill the cells with little or no effect of multidrug resistance. Results showed that mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNP) can be modified by cationic polymerpolyethylenimine (PEI) to obtain positive charges on the surface, which could enable the MSNP to carry MDR1-siRNA and DOX. The transfection efficiency assays demonstrated that the MSNP-PEI-DOX/MDR1-siRNA was efficiently transfected into KBV cells in vitro. KBV cells transfected with MSNP-PEI-DOX/MDR1-siRNA could effectively decrease gene expression of MDR1 (~70% increase after 72 hours posttreatment) and induce the apoptosis of KBV cells (24.27% after 48&nbsp;hours posttreatment) in vitro. Importantly, MSNP-PEI-DOX/MDR1-siRNA dramatically reduced the tumor size (81.64% decrease after 28&nbsp;days posttreatment) and slowed down tumor growth rate compared to the control group in&nbsp;vivo (P&lt;0.05). In the aggregate, newly synthesized MSNP-PEI-DOX/MDR1-siRNA improves cancer chemotherapy effect in terms of treating multidrug-resistant cancer compared to DOX only, clearly demonstrating that MSNP-PEI-DOX/MDR1-siRNA has potential therapeutic application for multidrug-resistant cancer in the future.

Himalaya, Central Nepal: Insights from titanite petrochronology", "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Greater Himalayan Sequence ( GHS ) has commonly been treated as a large coherently deforming high‐grade tectonic package, exhumed primarily by simultaneous thrust‐ and normal‐sense shearing on its bounding structures and erosion along its frontal exposure. A new paradigm, developed over the past decade, suggests that the GHS is not a single high‐grade lithotectonic unit, but consists of in‐sequence thrust sheets. In this study, we examine this concept in central Nepal by integrating temperature – time ( T–t ) paths, based on coupled Zr‐in‐titanite thermometry and U–Pb geochronology for upper GHS calcsilicates, with traditional thermobarometry, textural relationships and field mapping. Peak Zr‐in‐titanite temperatures are 760–850°C at 10–13 kbar, and U–Pb ages of titanite range from c . 30 to c . 15 Ma. Sector zoning of Zr and distribution of U–Pb ages within titanite suggest that diffusion rates of Zr and Pb are slower than experimentally determined rates, and these systems remain unaffected into the lower granulite facies. Two types of T–t paths occur across the Chame Shear Zone ( CSZ ). Between c. 25 and 17–16 Ma, hangingwall rocks cool at rates of 1–10°C/Ma, while footwall rocks heat at rates of 1–10°C/Ma. Over the same interval, temperatures increase structurally upwards through the hangingwall, but by 17–16 Ma temperatures converge. In contrast, temperatures decrease upwards in footwall rocks at all times. While the footwall is interpreted as an intact, structurally upright section, the thermometric inversion within the hangingwall suggests thrusting of hotter rocks over colder from c . 25 to c . 17–16 Ma. Retrograde hydration that is restricted to the hangingwall, and a lithological repetition of orthogneiss are consistent with thrust‐sense shear on the CSZ . The CSZ is structurally higher than previously identified intra‐ GHS thrusts in central Nepal, and thrusting duration was 3–6 Ma longer than proposed for other intra‐ GHS thrusts in this region. Cooling rates for both the hangingwall and footwall of the CSZ are comparable to or faster than rates for other intra‐ GHS thrust sheets in Nepal. The overlap in high‐ T titanite U–Pb ages and previously published muscovite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar cooling ages imply cooling rates for the hangingwall of ≥200°C/Ma after thrusting. Causes of rapid cooling include passive exhumation driven by a combination of duplexing in the Lesser Himalayan Sequence, and juxtaposition of cooler rocks on top of the GHS by the STDS . Normal‐sense displacement does not appear to affect T–t paths for rocks immediately below the STDS prior to 17–16 Ma.", "authors": ["Jesse B. Walters", "Matthew J.

These xenoliths were classified into two types. Clinopyroxenes (Cpx) in the type‐1 xenoliths are strongly enriched in large ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements (LREE) but depleted in high field‐strength elements and heavy rare earth elements, and show high Ca/Al, Zr/Hf, and (La/Yb) N ratios but low Ti/Eu ratios. These features indicate that they were crystallized from a carbonatitic melt. Cpx in the type‐2 xenoliths are mostly characterized by a chemical zonation, that is, LREE and Sr contents and (La/Yb) N and Eu/Ti ratios gradually increase from the cores to the rims. Some fresh cores preserve the original signatures of the depleted mantle. These observations indicate partial modification of pre‐existing Cpx by carbonatite metasomatism. Two episodes of metasomatism were identified based on Sr isotopic compositions of Cpx and carbonate inclusions within olivines. Both the carbonate inclusions and Cpx cores in the type‐2 xenoliths have relatively high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (&gt;0.7033), suggesting metasomatism due to CO 2 ‐rich silicate melt derived from the recycled oceanic crust. However, low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of Cpx rims in the type‐2 xenoliths suggest a late stage of metasomatism by a low‐ 87 Sr/ 86 Sr carbonatitic melt (&lt;0.7024), which might have been caused by upwelling of the asthenosphere mantle. Such multiple metasomatism could have played an important role in changing the chemical composition of mantle from refractory and depleted to fertile and enriched.", "authors": ["Lixu Deng",

The concentration‐normalised 57 Fe and 49 Ti responses in ilmenite were higher than those in NIST SRM 610 by a factor of 1.8 using fs‐ LA . Compared with the 193 nm excimer laser, smaller elemental fractionation was observed using the 257 nm fs laser. When using 193 nm excimer laser ablation, the selected range of the laser energy density had a significant effect on the elemental fractionation in ilmenite. Scanning electron microscopy images of ablation craters and the morphologies of the deposited aerosol materials showed more melting effects and an enlarged particle deposition area around the ablation site of the ns‐ LA ‐generated crater when compared with those using fs‐ LA . The ejected material around the ns crater predominantly consisted of large droplets of resolidified molten material; however, the ejected material around the fs crater consisted of agglomerates of fine particles with ‘rough' shapes. These observations are a result of the different ablation mechanisms for ns‐ and fs‐ LA s. Non‐matrix‐matched calibration was applied for the analysis of ilmenite samples using NIST SRM 610 as a reference material for both 193 nm excimer LA ‐ ICP ‐ MS and fs‐ LA ‐ ICP ‐ MS . Similar analytical results for most elements in ilmenite samples were obtained using both 193 nm excimer LA ‐ ICP ‐ MS at a high laser energy density of 12.7 J cm −2 and fs‐ LA ‐ ICP ‐ MS .", "authors": ["Zhen Li", "Zhaochu Hu", "Detlef Günther", "Keqing Zong", "Yongsheng Liu", "Tao Luo", "Wen Zhang", "Shan Gao", "Shenghong Hu"], "doi": "10.1111/ggr.12117", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ggr.12117", "published": "2016-03-24T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "采用UV纳秒和飞秒激光对钛铁矿的烧蚀特性：对非基体匹配定量的启示", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文研究了使用紫外纳秒和飞秒激光烧蚀钛铁矿时元素分馏和基体效应的差异，以实现非基体匹配定量分析。", "methodology": "研究采用了193 nm纳秒和257 nm飞秒紫外激光烧蚀系统与ICP-MS联用，并结合扫描电子显微镜分析烧蚀坑。", "key_findings": "飞秒激光烧蚀的元素分馏和熔融效应均小于纳秒激光，且在特定纳秒激光能量密度下，两种方法均可实现钛铁矿的非基体匹配定量分析。", "innovation": "该研究系统比较了纳秒和飞秒激光烧蚀钛铁矿的特性，并确定了实现非基体匹配定量分析的条件，为地质分析提供了新方法。", "relevance_note": "这项研究为地质学家优化LA-ICP-MS参数以准确分析钛铁矿提供了重要指导，即使在非基体匹配校准下也能进行可靠的岩石成因解释。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1111/ggr.12131", "title": "Calcium Isotopic Compositions of Sixteen <scp>USGS</scp> Reference Materials", "abstract": "Calcium isotopic compositions of sixteen Ca‐bearing USGS geological reference materials including igneous and sedimentary rocks are reported.

As opposed to common cation exchange resin, a micro‐column filled with Ca‐selective resin ( DGA resin) was used in order to achieve high recovery (&gt; 96%) and efficient separation of Ca from the sample matrix. The intermediate measurement precision was evaluated at 0.14‰ (2 s ) for δ 44/40 Ca SRM915a at GPMR , based on replicate measurements of pure Ca reference material NIST SRM 915a, NIST SRM 915b and seawater. Overall, the measurement uncertainties in both laboratories were better than 0.15‰ at the 2 s level. Result validation was carried out for all available data sets. The Ca isotopic compositions of USGS reference materials are not only in agreement between GPMR and CIG , but also in agreement with previously published data within quoted uncertainties.

At low to moderate temperatures, serpentinization of peridotite produces alkaline fluids that are rich in CH4 and H2. Upon mixing with seawater, these fluids precipitate carbonate, forming an extensive network of calcite veins in the basement rocks, while H2 and CH4 serve as an energy source for microorganisms. Here, we analyzed the carbon geochemistry of two ancient peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems: 1) ophiolites cropping out in the Northern Apennines, and 2) calcite-veined serpentinites from the Iberian Margin (Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 149 and 173), and compare them to active peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems such as the Lost City hydrothermal field (LCHF) on the Atlantis Massif near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR).Our results show that large amounts of carbonate are formed during serpentinization of mantle rocks exposed on the seafloor (up to 9.6 wt.% C in ophicalcites) and that carbon incorporation decreases with depth. In the Northern Apennine serpentinites, serpentinization temperatures decrease from 240 °C to &lt; 150 °C, while carbonates are formed at temperatures decreasing from ~ 150 °C to &lt; 50 °C. At the Iberian Margin both carbonate formation and serpentinization temperatures are lower than in the Northern Apennines with serpentinization starting at ~ 150 °C, followed by clay alteration at &lt; 100 °C and carbonate formation at &lt; 19-44 °C. Comparison with various active peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems on the MAR shows that the serpentinites from the Northern Apennines record a thermal evolution similar to that of the basement of the LCHF and that tectonic activity on the Jurassic seafloor, comparable to the present-day processes leading to oceanic core complexes, probably led to formation of fractures and faults, which promoted fluid circulation to greater depth and cooling of the mantle rocks. Thus, our study provides further evidence that the Northern Apennine serpentinites host a paleo-stockwork of a hydrothermal system similar to the basement of the LCHF. Furthermore, we argue that the extent of carbonate uptake is mainly controlled by the presence of fluid pathways. Low serpentinization temperatures promote microbial activity, which leads to enhanced biomass formation and the storage of organic carbon. Organic carbon becomes dominant with increasing depth and is the principal carbon phase at more than 50-100 m depth of the serpentinite basement at the Iberian Margin. We estimate that annually 1.1 to 2.7 × 1012 g C is stored within peridotites exposed to seawater, of which 30-40% is fixed within the uppermost 20-50 m mainly as carbonate. Additionally, we conclude that alteration of oceanic lithosphere is an important factor in the long-term global carbon cycle, having the potential to store carbon for millions of years.", "authors": ["Esther M.

The volcanic rocks are divided into three suites: tholeiitic basalts, calc-alkaline high-Mg# andesites and dominant dacites–rhyolites. The basalts (pillowed in places) show flat rare earth element (REE) and primordial mantle-normalized trace element patterns, but have minor negative Nb and Ta anomalies. They are interpreted as mantle plume-related oceanic plateau basalts whose source contained minor continental crustal input. The andesites are characterized by high Mg# (0.66–0.52), Cr and Ni, with depletion of high-field strength elements (HFSE) and enrichment of light REE (LREE) and large-ion lithophile elements (LILE). They were probably derived from a metasomatized mantle wedge overlying a subducted slab in a continental margin subduction zone.

Previous studies indicate that LASS2 is involved in the development of sensitivity to chemotherapy in cancer cells. In the present study, the miRNAs related to LASS2 were selected by using miRNA profiling to distinguish chemo-resistant and chemo-sensitive tumor specimens from patients. Higher levels of miR-93 were observed in the cisplatin-resistant BC cell line RT4, compared to the cell line T24. The role of miR-93 in chemo-sensitivity was demonstrated both in cell culture and mouse tumor xenograft models. We found that inhibiting miR-93 promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis due to the accumulation of DNA damage. A reporter gene assay was performed, and the results showed miR-93 was not a target of the 3&amp;amp;#39; untranslated region of LASS2, but had an altered protein expression level. Inhibitors of miR-93 could also enhance the chemo-sensitivity of tumor cells transfected with si-LASS2, but the effect was very slight. These findings suggest that miR-93 plays an important role in the chemo-sensitivity of BC, and may be involved in regulating the LASS2 gene.

Manassantin A (MA) derived from Saururus cernuus has been reported as a selective HIF-1 inhibitor. Herein, the structure of MA was optimized to achieve new derivatives with simple chemical properties while retaining its activity. LXY6090 was designed to replace the central tetrahydrofuran moiety of MA with a cyclopentane ring and was identified as a potent HIF-1 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 4.11&amp;nbsp;nM. It not only inhibited the activity of HIF-1 in breast cancer cells but also downregulated the protein level of HIF-1&amp;alpha;, which depended on von Hippel&amp;ndash;Lindau for proteasome degradation. The related biological evaluation showed that the activity of HIF-1 target genes, VEGF and IGF-2, was decreased by LXY6090 in breast cancer cell lines. LXY6090 presented potent antitumor activity in vitro. Furthermore, LXY6090 showed in vivo anticancer efficacy by decreasing the HIF-1&amp;alpha; expression in nude mice bearing MX-1 tumor xenografts. In conclusion, our data provide a basis for the future development of the novel compound LXY6090 as a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer.

The target ligands include antibodies, peptides, proteins, small molecules, and nucleic acid aptamers. Here, we utilize dipeptide Ser&ndash;Glu (DIP) as a new ligand to functionalize polymer-based fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) for pancreatic cancer target imaging. We demonstrate that in the first step, Ser&ndash;Glu-conjugated NPs (NPs-DIP) efficiently bind to AsPC-1 and in the following NPs-DIP are internalized into AsPC-1 in vitro. The peptide transporter 1 inhibition experiment reveals that the targeting effects mainly depend on the specific binding of DIP to peptide transporter 1, which is remarkably upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells compared with varied normal cells. Furthermore, NPs-DIP specifically accumulate in the site of pancreatic tumor xenograft and are further internalized into the tumor cells in vivo after intravenous administration, indicating that DIP successfully enhanced nanoparticles internalization efficacy into tumor cells in vivo.

We conclude that fluids from dehydration of the downgoing plate, focused to rise above the fore‐arc mantle corner, are responsible for ETS. There is a remarkable correspondence between the position of ETS and this corner along the whole margin. Hydrated mineral assemblages in the subducting oceanic crust and uppermost mantle are dehydrated with downdip increasing temperature, and seismic tomography data indicate that these fluids have strongly serpentinized the overlying fore‐arc mantle. Laboratory data show that such fore‐arc mantle serpentinite has low permeability and likely blocks vertical expulsion and restricts flow updip within the underlying permeable oceanic crust and subduction shear zone. At the fore‐arc mantle corner these fluids are released upward into the more permeable overlying fore‐arc crust. An indication of this fluid flux comes from low Poisson's Ratios (and V p / V s ) found above the corner that may be explained by a concentration of quartz which has exceptionally low Poisson's Ratio. The rising fluids should be silica saturated and precipitate quartz with decreasing temperature and pressure as they rise above the corner.", "authors": ["R. D. Hyndman", "Patricia A. McCrory", "A.

The low abundance 204 Pb (~ 1.4%) was collected using an IC. A NBS 981 standard solution was used to cross‐calculate the FC – IC gain and to investigate the signal response characteristics of the IC. A significant, continuous and linear decrease in the FC – IC gain was observed within 1 hr, but this drift could be corrected using the calibrator‐sample‐calibrator bracketing method. In addition, a non‐linear response of the IC used in this study was observed and corrected by a non‐linear correction algorithm, which was established by measuring a series of gravimetrically prepared NBS 981 standard solutions ( NIST SRM 981). Compared with the conventional arrangement, the use of the newly designed X skimmer cone and Jet sample cone improved the signal intensities from Pb isotopes by a factor of 1.9. Compared with only Faraday cups, using a combination FC – IC array was found to enhance the measurement repeatability ( RSD ) of 20x Pb/ 204 Pb by approximately one order of magnitude when the 204 Pb intensity was &lt; 8 mV . Eight natural glasses and the NIST SRM 612 reference material glass (as a calibration material) were measured to evaluate the new protocol for Pb isotope determination. The analytical results were in agreement with the reference values within 2 s measurement uncertainties. For MPI ‐ DING ATHO ‐G (5.67 μg g −1 total Pb), KL 2‐G (2.07 μg g −1 total Pb) and ML 3B‐G (1.38 μg g −1 total Pb), the typical accuracies of 20x Pb/ 204 Pb were 0.09% of preferred values with precisions of &lt; 0.33% (2 RSD ). The Pb isotope ratios in feldspars from granodiorite and within mafic microgranular enclaves ( MME s) from the Fangshan pluton, North China, were measured using the present method. The Pb isotopic compositions of feldspars from the whole host granodiorite show that that are radiogenic in the margin zone and gradually become less radiogenic. For the MME s, the Pb isotopic compositions of feldspars are highly variable and overlap with those of the whole host granodiorite. For single‐grain feldspar, the strong rim‐core‐rim variations of the Pb isotopic compositions and trace elements are interpreted to have been generated via magma mixing.

Sample digestion is a fundamental and critical stage in the process of geochemical analysis, which enables the acquisition of accurate trace element data by ICP ‐ MS . However, the conventional bomb digestion method with HF / HNO 3 results in a significant loss of rare earth elements ( REE s) due to the formation of insoluble AlF 3 precipitates during the digestion of bauxite samples. In this study, the digestion capability of the following methods was investigated: (a) ‘Mg‐addition’ bomb digestion, (b) NH 4 HF 2 open vessel digestion and (c) NH 4 F open vessel digestion. ‘Mg‐addition’ bomb digestion can effectively suppress the formation of AlF 3 and simultaneously ensure the complete decomposition of resistant minerals in bauxite samples. The addition of MgO to the bauxite samples resulted in (Mg + Ca)/Al ratios ≥ 1. However, adding a large amount of MgO leads to significant blank contamination for some transition elements (V, Cr, Ni and Zn). The NH 4 HF 2 or NH 4 F open vessel digestion methods can also completely digest resistant minerals in bauxite samples in a short period of time (5 hr). Unlike conventional bomb digestion with HF / HNO 3 , the white precipitates and the semi‐transparent gels present in the NH 4 HF 2 and NH 4 F digestion methods could be efficiently dissolved by evaporation with HC lO 4 . Based on these three optimised digestion methods, thirty‐seven trace elements including REE s in ten bauxite reference materials ( RM s) were determined by ICP ‐ MS . The data obtained showed excellent inter‐method reproducibility (agreement within 5% for REE s). The relative standard deviation (% RSD ) for most elements was &lt; 6%. The concentrations of trace elements in the ten bauxite RM s showed agreement with the limited certified (Li, V, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Zr and Pb) and information values (Co, Ba, Ce and Hf) available.

Both types of central inclusions are surrounded by cracks. The multiphase inclusions contain mica or carbonate minerals and are interpreted to represent decrepitated fluid inclusions. Examples from two localities are examined: (i) ultrahigh‐temperature (UHT) metapelitic gneisses from the southern end of the Central Maine Terrane in northeastern Connecticut, USA (rutile only) and (ii) ultrahigh‐pressure (UHP) diamondiferous saidenbachite from the Saxonian Erzgebirge (rutile and apatite). The needles of apatite or rutile are typically oriented in three directions within garnet. Chemical zonation in garnet shows clear Ti or P depletion halos corresponding spatially with the rutile or apatite inclusion halos. The radii of the inclusion halos, when measured from the centre of the central inclusions, are about two to several times the radii of the central inclusions. We propose that the inclusion halos of rutile ± apatite formed by exsolution out of Ti‐bearing and/or P‐bearing garnet during retrogression. Because of its strength, garnet can internally maintain higher pressures than the surrounding matrix. Nonetheless, if the inclusion pressure is significantly greater than the confining lithostatic pressure, then deformation of the host garnet can occur. During exhumation, high internal pressures relative to the matrix can result from retention of fluid entrapment pressure or a phase change with a large positive volume increase (e.g. coesite → quartz). The differential stress imposed on the garnet adjacent to the central inclusion preceding and during mechanical failure would create dislocations and other crystalline defects which are ideal sites for exsolved precipitates to nucleate and grow. The strain‐induced exsolution hypothesis is consistent with observations. (i) The radii of the halos are roughly consistent with the pressure vessel model or the multi‐anvil model for an inclusion, which predict that differential stress will drop off sharply away from the boundary of the central inclusion into the host garnet. (ii) The rutile or apatite inclusions formed in Ti‐ or P‐bearing garnet adjacent to ruptured central inclusions; rutile or apatite are rare or absent elsewhere in garnet, even in areas of high‐Ti or high‐P concentration. In addition, rutile is absent in areas surrounding the central inclusion that were depleted in Ti prior to rupturing (e.g. garnet rims that lost Ti during retrogression). Thus, both elevated Ti ± P concentrations and proximity to inclusions which deformed the host garnet were necessary for halo formation. (iii) Reintegrated garnet Ti or P contents in and adjacent to the halos obtained using wide‐beam electron probe microanalysis are consistent with local derivation of the Ti or P necessary to form rutile and apatite from garnet. Elevated Ti ± P concentrations in aluminous garnet are mostly found in UHT, HP/UHP, granulite and mantle environments. Consequently, the phenomena described will most likely occur in such settings.", "authors": ["Jennifer A. Axler", "Jay J.

Mineral carbonation, also called carbon mineralization, is the conversion of (fluid) carbon dioxide into (solid) carbonate minerals in rocks, by way of naturally occurring chemical reactions. Mafic and ultramafic rocks, such as volcanic basalt, are natural candidates for carbonation, because the magnesium and iron silicate minerals in these rocks react with brines of dissolved carbon dioxide to form carbonate minerals. By trapping carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) underground as a constituent of solid rock, carbonation of natural basalt formations would be a secure method of sequestering CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured at power plants in efforts to mitigate climate change. Geochemical laboratory experiments at Yale, carried out in a batch reactor at 200°C and 150 bar (15 MPa), studied carbonation of the olivine mineral forsterite (Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) reacting with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; brines in the form of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solutions. The main carbonation product in these reactions is the carbonate mineral magnesite (MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). A series of 32 runs varied the reaction time, the reactive surface area of olivine grains and powders, the concentration of the reacting fluid, and the starting ratio of fluid to olivine mass. These experiments were the first to study the rate of olivine carbonation under passive conditions approaching equilibrium. The results show that, in a simple batch reaction, olivine carbonation is fastest during the first 24 hours and then slows significantly and even reverses. A natural measure of the extent of carbonation is a quantity called the carbonation fraction, which compares the amount of carbon removed from solution, during a run, to the maximum amount that could have been removed if the olivine initially present had fully dissolved and the cations released had subsequently precipitated in carbonate minerals. The carbonation fractions observed in batch experiments with olivine grains and powders varied significantly, from less than 0.01 (1%) to more than 0.5 (50%). Over time, the carbonation fractions reached an upper limit after about 24 to 72 hours of reaction, then stayed constant or decreased. The peak Final Scientific/Technical Report DE-FE0004275 | Mineral Carbonation | 4 coincided with the appearance of secondary magnesium-bearing silicate minerals, whose formation competes for magnesium ions in solution and can even promote conditions that dissolve magnesite. The highest carbonation fractions resulted from experiments with low ratios of concentrated solution to olivine, during which amorphous silica spheres or meshes formed, instead of secondary silicate minerals. The highest carbonation fractions appear to result from competing effects. Precipitation of silica layers on olivine reduces the reactive surface area and, thus, the rate of olivine dissolution (which ultimately limits the carbonation rate), but these same silica layers can also inhibit the formation of secondary silicate minerals that consume magnesite formed in earlier stages of carbonation. Simulation of these experiments with simple geochemical models using the software program EQ3/6 reproduces the general trends observed—especially the results for the carbonation fraction in short-run experiments. Although further experimentation and better models are needed, this study nevertheless provides a framework for understanding the optimal conditions for sequestering carbon dioxide by reacting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-bearing fluids with rocks containing olivine minerals. A series of experiments at the Rock Physics Laboratory at the University of Maryland studied the carbonation process during deformation of thermally cracked olivine-rich rock samples (dunite) saturated with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; brines of varying compositions. A goal of these geomechanical experiments was to see if flow and deformation processes, which accompany natural carbonation reactions in underground settings, work to enhance or inhibit the reactions. The experiments involved hydrostatic compaction, followed by deformation at a constant rate of strain. Sample permeability was monitored during the reactions. Comparison of the samples’ volume changes to their axial strains (shortening) during deformation indicates that samples reacted with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-saturated brines accommodate more axial compaction, before the onset of dilation (a swelling that precedes rock failure), than samples reacted with distilled water. Analyses of the reacted samples with scanning electron microscope (SEM) images indicate, first, that dissolution of olivine occurring in the initial stages of carbonation can provide pathways to fluid flow that sustain the reaction, and, second, that carbonate minerals precipitated along existing fractures in the rocks may serve as asperities, or roughness on a crack’s surface that restricts its closure. Final Scientific/Technical Report DE-FE0004275 | Mineral Carbonation | 5 In a related study undertaken by one of the principal investigators as a spin-off of the main project, a simple model of (magnesite) crystal growth in the pore space of basalts undergoing carbonation was developed. The model suggests that, under a carefully controlled program of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection, carbonate mineral growth can harden the rock formation against earthquakes that might otherwise be induced by the injection of large fluid volumes (Yarushina and Bercovici, 2013). The overall conclusion of the research project is that mineral carbonation of underground mafic and ultramafic rock formations is a viable candidate for long-term sequestration of man-made carbon dioxide. No results obtained during the project indicate that the method is inherently intractable in its implementation; moreover, enormous volumes of basalt near Earth’s surface are candidate locations for large-scale injection programs. The geochemical experiments do indicate, however, that there will be significant engineering challenges in maintaining high rates of carbonation, by delaying the onset of chemical conditions that promote formation of secondary silicate minerals and, therefore, slow down, or even reverse, the carbonation process. It remains an open question as to whether carbonation processes can be sustained for many years in an engineered system operating on a large scale—a scale capable of accommodating millions of tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; annually. The development of realistic theoretical models that can systematically describe the combined effects of reactive flow, precipitation and geomechanical deformation is a major barrier to further understanding of the practical viability of mineral carbonation as large-scale method of carbon sequestration.", "authors": ["Zhengrong Wang", "Lin Qiu", "Shuang Zhang", "Edward W.

PLX4032 is the first effective compound in clinical use for the treatment of patients with mutant BRAFV600. However, resistance to PLX4032 develops quickly within months. Activation of a series of receptor tyrosine kinases, including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), has been identified to be the underlying mechanism for development of resistance to PLX4032. In this work, we investigated the anticancer activity of tyrphostin AG1296, a PDGFR inhibitor, in melanoma, especially PLX4032-resistant melanoma. We found that tyrphostin AG1296 could effectively reduce the viability of both PLX4032-sensitive and PLX4032-resistant melanoma cells. There is an additive effect between tyrphostin AG1296 and PLX4032 in reducing cell viability. Tyrphostin AG1296 induced dramatic apoptosis in PLX4032-resistant cells, and also dramatically inhibited migration of PLX4032-resistant cells. Importantly, tyrphostin AG1296 significantly suppressed A375R tumor growth in vivo. This is the first report on the anticancer activity of tyrphostin AG1296 in melanoma. Tyrphostin AG1296 is a promising compound in the treatment of melanoma, especially for those who have developed resistance towards BRAF inhibitors, and might shed new light on melanoma therapy.

CD44 is found to be closely linked to the development of various solid tumors. Molecular studies have revealed that high CD44 expression was correlated with the phenotypes of cancer stem cells and epithelial&amp;ndash;mesenchymal transition, thereby contributing to tumor invasion, metastasis, recurrence, and chemoresistance. Correspondingly, blockade of CD44 has been demonstrated to be capable of attenuating the malignant phenotype, slowing cancer progression, and reversing therapy resistance. Clinical analyses showed that high CD44 expression is associated with poor survival of various cancer patients, indicating that CD44 can be a potential prognostic marker.

We present geochemical evidence of active serpentinization in the Santa Elena Ophiolite, Costa Rica which is sustained by peridotites with a degree of serpentinization less than 50% with no evidence of an internal heat source. Average spring water temperatures are 29.1°C. Two hyperalkaline spring systems were discovered, with a spring fluid pH up to 11.18. The fluids are characterized by low Mg (1.0–5.9 mg/L) and K (1.0–5.5 mg/L) and relative high Ca (29–167 mg/L), Na (16–27 mg/L), Cl (26–29 mg/L), hydroxide (41–63 mg/L), and carbonate (31–49 mg/L). Active CH 4 (24.3% v/v) vents coupled with carbonate deposits ( ; ) also provide evidence for active serpentinization and carbonation. Isotope ratios of the alkaline fluids (δ 18 O = −7.9‰, δ 2 H = −51.4‰) and groundwater (δ 18 O = −7.6‰; δ 2 H = −48.0‰) suggests that, during base flow recession, springs are fed by groundwater circulation. Methanogenic Archaea, which comprises a relatively high percentage of the 16S rRNA gene tag sequences, suggests that biological methanogenesis may play a significant role in the system. Santa Elena's extreme varying weather results in a scenario that could be of significant importance for (a) improving the knowledge of conditions on a humid early Earth or Mars that had periodic changes in water supply, (b) revealing new insights on serpentinizing solute transport, and (c) modeling hydrogeochemical responses as a function of recharge.", "authors": ["Ricardo Sánchez‐Murillo", "Esteban Gazel", "Esther M.

With the wave stabilizer that has been developed, the signal stability was improved by a factor of 6.6-10 and no oscillation of the signal intensity was observed at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Another advantage of the wave stabilizer is that the signal decay time is similar to that without the signal-smoothing device (increased by only 1-2 s for a signal decay of approximately 4 orders of magnitude). Most of the normalized elemental signals (relative to those without the stabilizer) lie within the range of 0.95-1.0 with the wave stabilizer. Thus, the wave stabilizer device does not significantly affect the aerosol transport efficiency. These findings indicate that this device is well-suited for routine optimization of ICPMS, as well as low repetition rate laser ablation analysis, which provides smaller elemental fractionation and better spatial resolution. With the wave signal-smoothing and mercury-removing device, the mercury gas background is reduced by 1 order of magnitude. More importantly, the (202)Hg signal intensity produced in the sulfide standard MASS-1 by laser ablation is reduced from 256 to 0.7 mV by the use of the wave signal-smoothing and mercury-removing device. This result suggests that the mercury is almost completely removed from the sample aerosol particles produced by laser ablation with the operation of the wave mercury-removing device. The wave mercury-removing device that we have designed is very important for Pb isotope ratio and accessory mineral U-Pb dating analysis, where removal of the mercury from the background gas and sample aerosol particles is highly desired.

Methods The effect of serum containing Shancigu-Lufengfang on MDA-MB-231 cell viability was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT)assay. The invasion ability of the cells was measured by Transwell chamber. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR)technique was used to evaluate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9(MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1(TIMP-1)in MDA-MB-231 cells. Results Chinese herbal pair of Shancigu-Lufengfang showed an in-vitro killing rate of 35.86 % on MDA-MB-231 cells,and could obviously inhibit the invasion ability of MDA-MB-231 cells(P 0.01),the inhibition ratio being 34.8 %. MMP-9 mRNA expression was significantly decreased(P 0.05), while TIMP-1 mRNA expression was obviously increased(P 0.05),therefore the ratio of MMP-9 mRNA/TIMP-1 mRNA was reduced dramatically(P 0.05,P 0.01). Conclusion Chinese herbal pair of Shancigu-Lufengfang could inhibitthe invasion ability of MDA-MB-231 cells,and the inhibitive mechanism may be correlated with the down-regulation of MMP-9 mRNA and the UP-regulation of TIMP-1 mRNA, thus decreasing the ratio of MMP-9mRNA/ TIMP-1mRNA.", "authors": ["Yongsheng Liu"], "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2383120402", "published": "2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Traditional Chinese Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "中药对 Pseudobulbus Cremastrae seu Pleiones 和 Nidus Polistis Mandarini 抑制人乳腺癌 MDA-MB-231 细胞体外侵袭和转移的机制研究", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "探讨中药对山慈菇-露蜂房对人乳腺癌MDA-MB-231细胞体外侵袭和转移的抑制作用及机制。", "methodology": "采用MTT法检测细胞活力，Transwell小室法评估侵袭能力，RT-PCR检测MMP-9和TIMP-1 mRNA表达。", "key_findings": "山慈菇-露蜂房能抑制MDA-MB-231细胞侵袭，降低MMP-9 mRNA表达并升高TIMP-1 mRNA表达，从而降低MMP-9/TIMP-1比值。", "innovation": "本研究首次揭示了山慈菇-露蜂房对乳腺癌细胞侵袭的抑制作用及其MMP-9/TIMP-1分子机制。", "relevance_note": "为乳腺癌的潜在中药治疗提供了新的思路和作用机制，具有重要的临床转化价值。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "W2394280849", "title": "Study on Geological Characteristics and Prospecting Method of No.16 Block in Red Sea State in Northern Sudan", "abstract": "No. 16 block locates in Red Sea State in northern Sudan. 11 gold occurrences and 6 copper occurrences have been found in this area,4 prospective metallogenetic areas have been selected,and one mini type gold deposit has been evaluated as well.

The excess of HSE and the chondritic ratios of most HSE in primitive mantle (PM) have been interpreted to reflect the accretion of a chondritic ‘late veneer’ of about 0.5 % of Earth’s mass after core formation. The moderately volatile chalcogens S, Se and Te are moderately to highly siderophile at high pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions, thus, if depleted by core formation, their mantle abundances would reflect the volatile composition of the late veneer. Mantle peridotites with different extent of depletion by partial melting and re-enrichment by melt infiltration have been analyzed for abundances of S, Se and Te, in comparison to HSE, to constrain their abundances and ratios in the PM. Comparative studies of the Baldissero and Balmuccia peridotite bodies (Ivrea-Verbano Zone, Italian Alps) and of mantle pyroxenites from Balmuccia indicate details of the influence of partial melting and melt infiltration on abundances of HSE, S, Se and Te and 187Os/188Os in the mantle and fractionation of these elements during melt transport and redistribution in the mantle. At Balmuccia, Re depletion ages (TRD) of lherzolites and replacive dunites display a uniform distribution with a peak at 300-500 Ma. Baldissero peridotites also display a Paleozoic distribution peak but a significant number of samples yielded Proterozoic TRD. The different extents of preservation of ancient 187Os/188Os in Balmuccia and Baldissero peridotites reflect different degrees of isotopic homogenization and chemical re-equilibration with infiltrating incompatible element-depleted melt during the Paleozoic. The differences between the two bodies are also reflected by homogeneity of HSE and chalcogen abundances at Balmuccia. The lithophile element, HSE and chalcogen variations of different suites of lherzolites likely reflect different extents of reactive melt infiltration in mantle peridotites with partial re-equilibration and melt extraction in open system environments. The compositions and contact relations of the replacive Balmuccia dunites with the host lherzolites indicate that focused flow of sulfur-undersaturated melt occurred after the melting episode in the lherzolites. The compositional record of the Balmuccia massif thus reflects the composition of different types of melts and their interaction with the peridotites at different P-T conditions. Magmatic fractionation of chalcogens, the HSE and Os isotopes in websterites and spinel clinopyroxenites in the Balmuccia peridotite massif sheds significant insight on the connection between the reactive infiltration of mantle peridotites and pyroxenite formation and on the role of pyroxenites during melting of heterogeneous mantle. Both websterites and clinopyroxenites are consistent with crystal accumulation from S saturated melts but have different contents and fractionations of the HSE and chalcogens. Notably, in websterite parent melts, Re/Os, Pd/Ir, S/Re, S/Se, Se/Te, high HSE contents and initial Os isotopes are similar to values for secondary interstitial sulfides of refertilized peridotites reported in the literature, but different from unequilibrated sulfide inclusions in peridotite minerals. These observations suggest a common origin of sulfides precipitated from silicate melts during refertilization of peridotites and melts that have precipitated websterites. The similarities imply that open system melting of peridotites occurred by preferential removal of interstitial sulfides with silicate melts during melt extraction and melt- peridotite reaction. Clinopyroxenites have MORB-like HSE and chalcogen compositions and high S, Se and Re contents similar to websterites, but display lower abundances and stronger fractionations of other HSE and Te compared to websterites. Subparallel HSE patterns with several orders of magnitude variation and S/Se and Se/Te ratios suggest that clinopyroxenites formed from evolved melts that have undergone sulfide segregation in the mantle. Incomplete equilibration of infiltrating melts with peridotites and selective remelting of pyroxenites or veined peridotites can explain Os isotopic disequilibrium and heterogeneity in the mantle and in basalts. Results for mantle peridotites and pyroxenites are consistent with sulfide- silicate melt partitioning and mixing during reactive infiltration as the dominant control on abundances of the HSE, S, Se and Te in magmas and mantle rocks. Apparent partition coefficients during low to moderate degrees of melt extraction and subsequent fractional crystallization are: DPt &gt; DPd &gt; DTe &gt; DAu (?) &gt; DSe ≥ DS ≈ DRe. Variable degrees of refertilization of lherzolites apparently does not produce significant differences in HSE and chalcogen ratios such as Os/Ir, Ru/Ir, Rh/Ir, Pd/Pt, S/Se and Se/Te. A linear decrease of S abundances with decreasing Al2O3 contents, both for the whole data set of mantle peridotites, and for individual suites of peridotites, reflects sulfide removal controlled by sulfur solubility in silicate melt, or co-precipitation with pyroxenes and spinel. Similarly, Se and Te also display positive trends with Al2O3 and S contents, although with larger scatter. S/Se and Se/Te in the lherzolites change little with decreasing Al2O3, with a mean S/Se of 2690±700 (1σ, n=53) and Se/Te of 7.9±1.6 (1σ, n=63). Regression of abundances of S, Se, Te, Pd and Al2O3 contents in the peridotites yield minimum estimates on abundances of S, Se and Te in the PM (S=211±40 µg/g, Se=80±17 ng/g, Te =11.0±1.7 ng/g, 1σ; or 0.0040±0.0008×CI chondrites). The mean S/Se and Se/Te of mantle lherzolites overlap with CI chondrite values, and Se/Te in these samples are significantly different from ordinary and enstatite chondrites. The chalcogen/HSE ratio of the PM is similar to CM group carbonaceous chondrites, consistent with the view that the HSE signature of the PM reflects a predominance of slightly volatile depleted carbonaceous chondrite like material, possibly with a minor proportion of non-chondritic material. The chondritic composition indicates that the proportion of chalcogens in the mantle that are leftover from core formation must be negligible. A volatile- rich late veneer after formation of Earth’s core may have provided from 20 % to 100 % of the budget of water and carbon in the silicate Earth. Geological reference materials with variable composition and NIST SRM 612 have been analyzed to evaluate the utility of the analytical methods newly developed in this work. The results show that the method may minimize loss of volatile chalcogens during the closed-system digestion of a high pressure asher and indicates different extent of heterogeneity of chalcogens and HSE at low test portion size and importance of obtaining HSE and chalcogen contents in the same sample aliquot.", "authors": ["Zaicong Wang"], "doi": "10.17169/refubium-10257", "url": "https://doi.org/10.17169/refubium-10257", "published": "2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Refubium (Universitätsbibliothek der Freien Universität Berlin)", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "地球地幔岩石中硫族元素和高亲铁元素丰度对地幔过程和晚期增生的制约", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在利用硫族元素和高亲铁元素丰度及Os同位素，约束地球晚期增生历史和地幔过程。", "methodology": "研究分析了Ivrea-Verbano带的地幔橄榄岩和辉石岩中的硫族元素、HSE丰度及Os同位素，并评估了新开发的分析方法。", "key_findings": "原始地幔的硫族元素/HSE比值与CM球粒陨石相似，表明晚期增生主要为贫挥发性碳质球粒陨石物质，且核幔分异后地幔中硫族元素残留量可忽略。", "innovation": "本研究开发并评估了新的硫族元素分析方法，可最大程度减少高压灰化密闭消化过程中挥发性硫族元素的损失。", "relevance_note": "这项研究深化了对地球晚期增生、地幔过程和挥发性元素来源的理解，对行星演化模型至关重要。"}}]}, {"name": "2013", "count": 45, "works": [{"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1007/978-3-642-35795-4_56", "title": "OpenVPN Traffic Identification Using Traffic Fingerprints and Statistical Characteristics", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Yi Pang", "Shuyuan Jin", "Shicong Li", "Jilei Li", "Hao Ren"], "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-35795-4_56", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35795-4_56", "published": "2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Communications in computer and information science", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "李继磊"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "基于流量指纹和统计特征的OpenVPN流量识别", "domain": "其他", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在解决如何有效识别网络中OpenVPN加密流量的问题。", "methodology": "研究采用流量指纹和统计特征分析相结合的方法来识别OpenVPN流量。", "key_findings": "研究发现通过结合流量指纹和统计特征可以有效且准确地识别OpenVPN流量。", "innovation": "创新点在于提出并验证了一种基于流量指纹和统计特征的OpenVPN流量识别新方法。", "relevance_note": "这项研究对网络安全、流量管理和VPN流量检测等领域的研究者具有重要价值。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1007/s11434-013-5901-4", "title": "Applications of LA-ICP-MS in the elemental analyses of geological samples", "abstract": "Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), which is a rapidly developing analytical technique for the analyses of trace elements and isotopes, plays an important role in advancing the study of Earth science, especially with respect to micro-geochemistry.

Cinnabar was used for millennia to make vermillion, a red pigment that was highly valued in pre-Hispanic Peru; metallic Hg(0) has been used since the mid-16th century to conduct mercury amalgamation, an efficient process of extracting precious metals from ores. However, little is known about which cinnabar deposits were exploited by pre-Hispanic cultures, and the environmental consequences of Hg mining and amalgamation remain enigmatic. Here we use Hg isotopes to source archeological cinnabar and to fingerprint Hg pollution preserved in lake sediment cores from Peru and the Galápagos Islands. Both pre-Inca (pre-1400 AD) and Colonial (1532-1821 AD) archeological artifacts contain cinnabar that matches isotopically with cinnabar ores from Huancavelica, Peru, the largest cinnabar-bearing district in Central and South America. In contrast, the Inca (1400-1532 AD) artifacts sampled are characterized by a unique Hg isotopic composition. In addition, preindustrial (i.e., pre-1900 AD) Hg pollution preserved in lake sediments matches closely the isotopic composition of cinnabar from the Peruvian Andes. Industrial-era Hg pollution, in contrast, is distinct isotopically from preindustrial emissions, suggesting that pre- and postindustrial Hg emissions may be distinguished isotopically in lake sediment cores.", "authors": ["Colin A.

In this study, we investigate the effects of the addition of water and/or ethanol vapor to the central gas flow (Ar + He) of an Ar plasma in combination with a shielded torch on the signal intensity of laser-generation using an 193 nm ArF laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) setup. A custom-built sample introduction system was developed to add water and/or ethanol vapor to dry aerosol at different and constant rates. The optimum makeup gas flow rate is negatively correlated with the water and/or ethanol load into the ICP. The effect of the shielded torch on the LA-ICP-MS sensitivity is minimal for dry plasma conditions but becomes significant in the presence of water and/or 1–4% (v/v) ethanol vapor. For most of the 60 investigated elements reported in this study, the addition of small amounts of water and/or 1–4% (v/v) ethanol vapor into the carrier gas increases the sensitivity by a factor of 2.5–3.0 or 1.2–1.5 with or without the shielded torch, respectively. The suppression of the ion kinetic energy distribution by the shield in the presence of water and/or 1–4% ethanol vapor may account for the increase in sensitivity. With the shielded torch, the oxide ratio increases from 0.47% in dry plasma to 6.41% in water plasma and decreases to 0.81% in 4% ethanol plasma. Hydride formation increases by a factor of 27 in the presence of 4% ethanol vapor relative to dry plasma.

Relative to the spatial profiles of the ion distributions in dry plasma, the addition of water and/or 2% (v/v) ethanol vapor in combination with a shielded torch shows several effects: (1) axial profiles are significantly narrower; (2) the maximum ion density zone shifts away from the load coil; and (3) there are more uniform ion distributions for elements with different physical and chemical properties.

Accordingly, metamorphic reactions that involve water, namely dehydration and partial melting reactions, adjust their P–T positions to accommodate the change of . In this modelling study, pseudosections are calculated for graphite‐bearing systems that are either closed or that progressively lose fluid and/or melt. The diagrams incorporate a new model of CO 2 solubility in felsic melts that we derived to be compatible with a recently published melt model. As the result of the lowered in the carbon‐bearing systems, the temperature displacements of the solidus can be as large as 50 °C at low pressures in cordierite‐bearing zones (&lt;4 kbar), but are smaller than 15 °C at mid‐pressure P–T conditions (4–9 kbar). In the supersolidus region, the phase relations among silicate minerals + melt are very close to those in carbon‐free systems. The fluid CO 2 content increases as temperature increases in the supersolidus assemblages. The CO 2 ‐rich fluid can be stable in granulite facies conditions in an oxidized system. In graphitic systems, melt and/or cordierite dominate the CO 2 budget of high‐grade rocks. During cooling, the fluid that exsolves from such crystalizing melt is CO 2 ‐rich. In addition to the phase relations, the pseudosections presented in this study enable researchers to quantitatively investigate the evolution of phase modes, including graphite, along specific metamorphic P–T paths. At low pressures in the cordierite stability field, graphite is predicted to precipitate as the pressure increases or temperature decreases in the subsolidus assemblages, or temperature increases in the region of melt + fluid coexistence. On the other hand, the graphite abundance remains nearly constant along the mid‐pressure P–T series, but the graphite mode in the supersolidus region may increase due to residual enrichment if the melt is extracted. The modelling results show that metamorphic processes in closed systems lead to only small changes in graphite mode (a few tenths of a per cent). This strongly suggests that open‐system behaviours are required for large amounts of graphite deposition, including fluid infiltration and mixing or residual enrichment processes in high‐grade rocks. In addition to P–T pseudosections, P / T–X O diagrams ( X O = O/(H + O) in the fluid) illustrate the thermodynamic features of internal buffering from another perspective, and explore the dependence of phase relations on the externally imposed redox state.

The volcanic rocks are divided into three suites: tholeiitic basalts, calc-alkaline high-Mg# andesites and dominant dacites–rhyolites. The basalts (pillowed in places) show flat rare earth element (REE) and primordial mantle-normalized trace element patterns, but have minor negative Nb and Ta anomalies. They are interpreted as mantle plume-related oceanic plateau basalts whose source contained minor continental crustal input. The andesites are characterized by high Mg# (0.66–0.52), Cr and Ni, with depletion of high-field strength elements (HFSE) and enrichment of light REE (LREE) and large-ion lithophile elements (LILE). They were probably derived from a metasomatized mantle wedge overlying a subducted slab in a continental margin subduction zone. The dacites–rhyolites are silicic rocks (SiO 2 =61–72 wt%) with low Cr and Ni, K 2 O/Na 2 O mostly 0.5–1.1, highly fractionated REE patterns, enrichments of LILE and distinctly negative HFSE anomalies. One rhyolite sample yielded a zircon U–Pb age of 2353±32 Ma. This suite is similar to potassic adakites and is explained as the product of deep melting of thickened crust in the arc with a significant older crustal component. Collision between a continental margin arc with an oceanic plateau followed by slab break-off, upwelling of hot asthenosphere and extensive crustal reworking in a sustained compressional regime is proposed for the geodynamic evolution of the area. This is in corroboration with the scenario of EDC as a Neoarchaean hot orogen as suggested recently by some workers.

Garnet occurs in ultramafic to felsic bulk-rock compositions, and its growth and stability span from <300 to 2000 °C and from atmospheric pressure to 25 GPa. More than merely a constituent of these rocks, garnet possesses chemical and physical attributes allowing it to record, and influence, a diverse suite of tectonic, metamorphic, and mantle processes, making it uncommonly useful in geoscientific inquiry. Because of its myriad colors, garnet has been used through the ages in jewelry. More recently, nonsilicate crystals with the garnet structure have been fabricated for sophisticated laser, magnetic, and ion-conducting technologies.

Porphyroblastic textures carry quantitative signals of protracted nucleation and sluggish intergranular diffusion, key impediments to reaction progress that may result in crystallization under conditions well removed from equilibrium. Growth zoning in garnet reveals partial chemical equilibration with matrix minerals: intergranular transport keeps pace with garnet growth for some elements but not for others, leading to variable degrees and length scales of chemical equilibration. Partial relaxation of compositional zoning by intracrystalline diffusion is a sensitive and quantitative indicator of thermal history, constraining rates and timescales of peak metamorphic heating, processes of burial and exhumation, and retrogression on cooling.

Methods The nude mice model with bone metastases of breast cancer was established, and then the modeled mice were treated with BFD and drug pair of Radix Aconite Preparata(Fuzi)and Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae(Baizhu),respectively. After treatment,the survival time of nude mice was observed, the count of osteoclast was detected after tartrate- resistant acid phosphatase(TRACP)staining,the gene expression of macrophage colony stimulating facto(rM- CSF)and parathyroid hormone related peptide(PTHrP)in the bone metastases of breast cancer was examined by the RT- PCR and their protein expression was detected by Western blot method. Results Compared with the model group,the survival time was obviously prolonged(P0.01),the amount of TRACP positive cells in the bone metastases of breast cancer was reduced(P 0.01),M- CSF and PTHrP mRNA relative expression levels as well as their protein relative expression levels were decreased obviously(P 0.01) in B FD group and Fuzi-Baizhu drug pair group.

"Geological reference materials ( RM s) with variable compositions and NIST SRM 612 were analysed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry for bulk rock concentrations of chalcogen elements (sulfur, selenium and tellurium), rhenium and platinum‐group elements ( PGE s: Ru, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt), including the isotope amount ratios of 187 Os/ 188 Os. All concentrations were obtained from the same aliquot after HC l‐ HNO 3 digestion in a high pressure asher at 320 °C. Concentrations were determined after chemical separation by negative TIMS , ICP ‐ MS and hydride generation ICP ‐ MS (Se, Te). As in previous studies, concentrations of the PGE s in most RM s were found to be highly variable, which may be ascribed to sample heterogeneity at the &lt; 1 g level. In contrast, S, Se and Te displayed good precision ( RSD &lt; 5%) in most RM s, suggesting that part of the PGE budget is controlled by different phases, compared with the chalcogen budget. The method may minimise losses of volatile chalcogens during the closed‐system digestion and indicates the different extent of heterogeneity of chalcogens, Re and PGE s in the same sample aliquot. OKUM , SC o‐1, MRG ‐1, DR ‐N and MAG ‐1 are useful RM s for the chalcogens.

This study uses computer modeling to construct the pressure-temperature (P-T) history of a gneiss from an extinct collision zone to test the extent of ultra high-pressure metamorphism (greater than or equal to 25 kbar at 750°C). Field evidence of crystallized melt and an alkali-feldspar reaction found in the sample suggest a history of melt loss during the early stages of metamorphism. A P-T diagram constructed from the pre melt-loss sample composition, predicts ~20-35 vol percent melt coexisted with the observed assemblage, ~80-85 percent of which was lost during peak metamorphism. Before melt-loss, the gneiss passed through the alkali-feldspar reaction (~15.5 kbar, 750°C) to the formation of the observed mineral group (~12 kbar, 850°C). Diagrams constructed for the post melt-loss composition predict the observed minerals to form at ~11-15 kbar and ~810-870°C, which is consistent with previous estimates for rocks hosted by the gneiss. Predicted mineral abundances match observed values, with 8-18 vol percent garnet and 0-10 vol percent biotite in the diagram, and 10-15 vol percent garnet and 10 vol percent biotite in the sample. Mineral compositions converge at ~12-12.5 kbar and ~660-700°C, which agree with previous P-T estimates for the gneiss and suggests diffusion altered mineral compositions.

These rocks form a bimodal volcanic suite consisting mainly of silicic metavolcanic rocks with subordinate metabasalts. Five silicic metavolcanic samples dated at ca. 492 Ma and one metabasalt sample yielding a near-concordant Pb-206/U-238 age of 492 +/- 4 Ma indicate that mafic and silicic eruptions were contemporaneous. The metabasalts are mostly high-K calc-alkaline, enriched in Th, U, and light rare earth elements (LREEs), and depleted in Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr, and Hf, geochemically resembling the Andean arc basalts. The silicic metavolcanic rocks are high-K calc-alkaline and low in Nb and Zr. The metabasaltic rocks have negative whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-4.7 to -3.5) and varying zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-0.7 to +7.5), differing significantly from those of the silicic metavolcanic rocks, which yield negative whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) values of -8.4 to -7.2 and varying zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-13.9 to -4.6). The metabasaltic rocks are interpreted as resulting from partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle source that was metasomatized by subduction-related components, whereas the silicic metavolcanic rocks were derived from basaltic melt-induced anatexis of the ancient Lhasa basement with inherited mantle melt signatures. The Western Qiangtang-Amdo-Tethyan Himalaya situated in the Indian proto-Tethyan margin and the Lhasa and other possible microcontinents or terranes (e.g., Gongshan, Baoshan, Tengchong, Burma, and Sibumasu) paleographically located in the Australian proto-Tethyan margin represent an early Paleozoic Andean-type magmatic arc facing the proto-Tethyan Ocean. The emplacement of the bimodal volcanic rocks and the development of the Cambro-Ordovician angular unconformity in the central Lhasa subterrane can be attributed to slab break-off of the proto-Tethyan Ocean lithosphere following the collisional accretion of microcontinents or terranes located outboard of the magmatic arc (possibly Eastern Qiangtang and South China).

Here we report comprehensive data on petrology, geochemistry, Sr–Nd–Pb isotopes and zircon U–Pb and Hf isotopic compositions from the intrusive complex. LA–ICPMS zircon U–Pb ages show that this complex was emplaced at 180.1–184.7 Ma. The fine-grained quartz monzonite and porphyritic quartz monzonite have similar major and trace elements features, implying a similar petrogenetic history. Coupled with the widespread Neoarchean inherited zircons in these rocks, the high SiO2 and Na2O as well as the low MgO contents and low Pb isotopic ratios ((206Pb/204Pb)i = 15.850–16.881, (207Pb/204Pb)i = 14.932–15.261, (208Pb/204Pb)i = 35.564–36.562) of the quartz monzonites suggest an origin from ancient tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) crust. However, their higher Nd and Hf isotopic ratios (εNd (t) = − 11.7 to − 7.0, εHf (t) = − 25.0 to − 10.3) as compared to the basement rocks indicate input of enriched lithospheric mantle-derived materials. The coarse- to fine-grained porphyritic syenites were derived from similar sources as inferred from their comparable major and trace elements contents as well as the Nd, Hf and Pb isotopic compositions. The Neoarchean inherited zircons and depletion of Nb, Ta, P and Ti in these rocks indicate the involvement of ancient crust. However, the high Nd and Hf isotopic ratios (εNd (t) = − 0.8 to 1.5, εHf (t) = − 4.4 to 4.8) coupled with high Pb isotopic compositions ((206Pb/204Pb)i = 18.082–19.560, (207Pb/204Pb)i = 15.510–15.730, (208Pb/204Pb)i = 37.748–39.498) suggest that the porphyritic syenites were mainly derived from an asthenospheric mantle. Based on the geochemical and isotopic features, a magmatic process similar to MASH (melting, assimilation, storage and homogenization) is proposed for the fine-grained quartz monzonite and AFC (assimilation and fractional crystallization) is envisaged for the porphyritic quartz monzonite and porphyritic syenites. Our data suggest the interaction of various crustal and mantle sources including lower to upper crust, lithospheric mantle and asthenospheric mantle in the generation of the Tongshi intrusive complex. Sharing common characteristics with other post-collisional magmatic rocks, the high-K calc-alkaline and shoshonitic rocks from the Tongshi complex are considered to have originated in post-collisional setting, marking the beginning of lithospheric destruction in the inner domains of the NCC during Mesozoic.", "authors": ["Ting‐Guang Lan", "Hong‐Rui Fan", "M.

Open-vessel acid digestions successfully dissolve mafic samples, but this method cannot achieve complete dissolution of felsic samples, because of the presence of refractory minerals such as zircon. In this study, an efficient and simplified digestion technique using the solid compound NH(4)HF(2) in a screw-top vial has been developed for multielement analysis of different types of rock samples. NH(4)HF(2) has a higher boiling point (239.5 °C) than conventional acids such as HF, HNO(3) and HCl, which allows for an elevated digestion temperature in open vessels, enabling the decomposition of refractory phases. Similar to HF, HNO(3) and HCl, ultrapure NH(4)HF(2) can be produced using a conventional PFA sub-boiling (heating and cooling) purification system. A digestion time of 2-3 h for 200 mg NH(4)HF(2) in a Savillex Teflon vial at 230 °C is sufficient to digest 50 mg of the felsic rock GSP-2, which is ~6 times faster than using conventional closed-vessel acid digestion at 190 °C (high-pressure PTFE digestion bomb). The price of a Savillex Teflon vial is far less than the price of a high-pressure PTFE digestion bomb (consisting of a PTFE inner vessel and an outer stainless steel pressure jacket). Moreover, the NH(4)HF(2)-open-vessel acid digestion is not hampered by the formation of insoluble fluorides. We have successfully applied the NH(4)HF(2)-open-vessel acid digestion to the digestion of a series of international geological reference materials, including mafic to felsic igneous rocks and shales.

The signal sensitivities of Hf, Yb and Lu were improved by a factor of 1.4 and 2.5, respectively, with using the X skimmer cone + standard sampler cone and the X skimmer cone + Jet sample cone compared to the standard arrangement (H skimmer cone + standard sample cone). However, when using the high-sensitivity Jet sample cone, the instrumental mass fractionation for hafnium displayed a large non-linear component that could not be corrected using the normal mass fractionation laws. The magnitude of this non-linear mass fractionation was strongly related to the central gas flow rate. The in situ Hf isotope analysis of zircon standards 91500 and Mud Tank using the Jet cone displayed large deviations (410–470 ppm) at the optimum central gas flow rate for Hf, which seriously deteriorated the performance of the Jet cone. The addition of 4 ml min−1 nitrogen to the central gas flow in laser ablation MC-ICP-MS was found to not only increase the sensitivity of Hf by a factor of 2.1, but also suppress this non-linear mass fractionation. The determined Yb/Hf and Lu/Hf ratios at their corresponding optimum makeup gas flow rates for Hf intensity were found to be reduced by factors of 2 and 1.3 in the presence of nitrogen, respectively, which would benefit the accurate in situ determination of Hf isotopes in high-content Yb and Lu samples. Compared to the standard arrangement, the corresponding precision (2σ) of 176Hf/177Hf for single spot analysis of zircon standard 91500 was improved from 224 ppm to 50 ppm by using the newly designed X-skimmer cone and Jet sample cone in combination with the nitrogen addition technique.

This interpretation, however, remains highly contentious, particularly when applied to northern Tibet where crustally derived magmatic rocks are scarce. Here we report the finding of tourmaline-bearing mica and biotite rhyolites in the Bukadaban–Malanshan area, southern Kunlun Range, near the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Zircon U–Pb and whole-rock or mineral 40Ar–39Ar analyses suggest that these rocks erupted between 9·0 and 1·5 Ma. These rocks are geochemically similar to Himalayan leucogranites (interpreted as crustal melts), with strongly peraluminous compositions, high SiO2 contents (69·0–76·0 wt %), and clear negative Eu, Ba and Sr anomalies. They have low εNd (–5·8 to –8·6) and high 87Sr/86Sr (0·7125–0·7178), 206Pb/204Pb (18·59–18·70), 207Pb/204Pb (15·49–15·63) and 208Pb/204Pb (38·31–38·74) isotopic compositions as well as magmatic zircon εHf (–0·7 to –5·0) compositions similar to those of global marine sediments and Proterozoic–Triassic sedimentary rocks in northern Tibet. We suggest that the Bukadaban–Malanshan rhyolites were generated by dehydration melting of metasedimentary rocks at 0·5–1·2 GPa and 740–863°C. Our data not only confirm the occurrence of a partially molten zone in the mid- to lower crust beneath northern Tibet but also constrain the crustal melting to have existed from middle Miocene to Quaternary times. Adopting the crustal flow model, we further argue the importance of outward flowing of the melt-weakened crust in the formation of crustal inflation, surface uplift, and earthquakes along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.", "authors": ["Qiang Wang", "Sun‐Lin Chung", "Xinyuan Li", "Derek A.

The Tarim Craton is located at the southernmost margin of the CAOB. In this study, the discovery of early Palaeozoic high‐pressure (HP) granulites from the Dunhuang block in the northeastern Tarim Craton is reported, and these rocks are characterized through detailed petrological and geochronological studies. The peak mineral assemblage of the HP mafic granulite is garnet + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + quartz + rutile, which is overprinted by amphibolite facies retrograde metamorphic assemblages. The calculated P–T conditions of the peak metamorphism are ∼1.4–1.7 GPa and ∼800 °C. The retrograde P–T conditions are ∼0.7 GPa and ∼700 °C. The metamorphic zircon grains from the HP mafic granulite show homogeneous CL‐images, low Th/U ratios and flat HREE patterns and yield a weighted mean 206 Pb/ 238 U age of 444 ± 5 Ma. The metamorphic zircon grains from the associated kyanite‐bearing garnet gneiss and garnet‐mica schist show a similar 206 Pb/ 238 U age of 429 ± 3 and 435 ± 4 Ma, respectively. The c. 440–430 Ma age is interpreted to mark the timing of HP granulite facies metamorphism in the Dunhuang block. The results from this study suggest that the Dunhuang block experienced continental subduction prior to the early Palaeozoic collisional orogeny between the northeastern Tarim Craton and the southern CAOB, and the Dunhuang area could be considered as the southward extension of the CAOB.

Felsic rocks are known to be very difficult to dissolve because of the presence of refractory minerals such as zircon. In this study, we undertook a systematic evaluation of the effect of the HF/HNO3 ratio, digestion time, digestion temperature, digested test portion mass and the presence of insoluble fluorides on analytical results for the felsic rock GSP-2 using high-pressure HF and HF/HNO3 digestion. Digestion in mixtures of HF and HNO3 acids is a commonly used method of dissolution for geological samples. However, our results clearly indicate that adding HNO3 inhibited the digestion capabilities of HF for refractory minerals such as zircon. It took 8–12 hr for Zr to be completely recovered in GSP-2 at 190 °C, whereas it needed about 36 and 72 hr at 160 and 140 °C, respectively. White precipitates were observed in the final solution for test portion mass > 100 mg, irrespective of which of the five different digestion solutions was used (1 ml HF, 2 ml HF, 1 ml HF + 0.5 ml HNO3, 1 ml HF + 1 ml HNO3 and 1.5 ml HF + 1.5 ml HNO3). Environmental scanning electron microscopy showed that these precipitates were mainly composed of AlF3. Instead of further HCl, HNO3 or HClO4 attack, we propose that using ultra-fine samples and a small sample size is a good way to avoid the formation of insoluble residues (e.g., fluorides). To further investigate the precision and accuracy of the proposed method (using HF alone as the digestion solution during the first acid attack step), a suite of silicate rock reference materials was analysed. Most of the results were found to be in reasonable agreement with the reference values, with a relative error of < 10%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUne dissolution complete est essentielle pour obtenir des resultats precis au cours de l’analyse des echantillons geologiques. Les roches felsiques sont connues pour etre tres difficile a dissoudre a cause de la presence de mineraux refractaires tels que le zircon.

La digestion dans un melange d’acides HF et HNO3 est une methode de dissolution couramment utilisee pour les echantillons geologiques.

The rocks, which form part of the Acadian (Devonian) metamorphic belt in Connecticut (United States), reached ∼1000 °C and minimum pressures of ∼1 GPa based on Zr-in-rutile thermometry, ternary feldspar compositions, and pseudosection analysis. This is the first regional UHT locality in the United States of which we are aware, and one of relatively few post-Gondwana assembly UHT localities known worldwide. The UHT metamorphism requires heretofore unrecognized contributions to the regional thermal budget. Some possibilities include rapid exhumation from the mantle, underthrusting of extremely radiogenic crust, mechanical strain heating, asthenospheric upwelling, and/or heat input from mantle-derived magmas. The rocks are fairly ordinary looking in outcrop, raising the possibility that other UHT domains remain undiscovered in the orogen.

Connecticut, and present a precipitation model for their origin. The rocks were strongly metamorphosed and deformed during the Devonian Acadian orogeny. The needles are primarily elongated parallel to <111> in garnet. Rutile has anomalous extinction angles as great as ~35° (cf. Griffin et al. 1971). Rutile and ilmenite needles are typically a few hundred nanometers to several micrometers in diameter and are several tens of micrometers to nearly a millimeter long. Other oxide inclusions that may be present include submicrometer- to micrometer-scale twinned rutile bicrystals, as well as srilankite and a crichtonite group mineral. Some garnet cores have unusual, box-shaped quartz inclusions, which coexist with Ti±Fe oxide needles and commonly contain micrometer-scale rods of F-OH-C1 apatite. Negative garnet ciystal \"pores\" are also widespread. Ti±Fe oxide needles are restricted to garnet core regions; rims have a distinctly different inclusion population dominated by granulite facies minerals including sillimanite, spinel, cordierite, and K-feldspar. Consequently, the garnet core regions represent an earlier, distinct period of growth relative to the rims. Garnet cores contain ~25-35% pyrope. and a host of minor and trace constituents including TiO2 (0.07-0.6 wt%). Cr203 (0.01-0.10 wt%). Na2O (0.01-0.03 wt%). P2O5 (0.01-0.09 wt%). and ZrO2 (up to -150 ppm). Na2O and ZrO2 correlate positively with TiO2.Titanium zoning is preserved in some garnets; zoning profiles and two-dimensional chemical mapping show' that Ti and. to a lesser degree. Cr are depleted around Ti±Fe oxide inclusions. Therefore, we conclude that the needles are precipitates that formed from Ti-bearing garnet during exhumation and cooling. Garnet contained sufficient Ti to form precipitates; no Ti source external to garnet was necessary. Titanium­bearing garnets that contain oriented Ti±Fe oxide needles are known primarily from ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic rocks, mantle peridotites and pyroxenites, and high-pressure granulites. Thus, the presence of needle-bearing garnets in Connecticut strongly suggests that a previously unrecognized domain of extreme pressure and/or temperature metamorphism exists in the Acadian orogen.", "authors": ["Jay J.

Fifteen samples recording progressive metamorphism from the chlorite through the sillimanite-K-feldspar zones were investigated by: (1) SIMS U-Pb depth profiling into rims of unpolished zircon grains to analyze sub-micrometer-scale features, and (2) conventional spot analysis on sectioned and polished grains. Spot analyses of zircon interiors yield pre-metamorphic detrital ages for all metamorphic grades. Most are in the range ca. 600 to ca. 2000 Ma, but some stretch back to the Archean. Younger ages are recorded in zircon rims, but zircon rim alteration at lower metamorphic grades occurs over much shorter length scales (the outer ~80 nm to ~1 μm of the grain) than in the upper amphibolite to granulite facies (rims of 10 to 30 μm). For example, Grampian (~470 Ma) metamorphism from the garnet and kyanite zones affected only the outermost rims (<1 μm) of detrital zircon grains. Thicker, 10 to 30 μm rims that could be dated by conventional spot analysis developed only at high grades in the sillimanite and sillimanite-K-feldspar zones, probably in the presence of partial melt. The mean Grampian zircon age from spot and depth profile analyses is 472 ± 4 Ma (n = 19). In addition to Grampian ages, the zircon depth profiles reveal ages related to five main events that postdate the Grampian Orogeny: decompression melting at ca. 450 Ma; subduction and I-type granite intrusion at ca. 420 Ma; granite intrusion at ca. 384 Ma; extensionrelated volcanism and vein mineralization at ca. 335 Ma, and further rifting and basaltic magmatism at ca. 250 Ma. These events are recorded only in the very narrow rims (<1 μm) of zircons, and are thus undetectable with conventional spot analysis. We conclude that: (1) zircon interiors were able to retain detrital ages up to and including the highest grade of Barrovian metamorphism (sillimanite-Kfeldspar zone), and (2) the <1 μm thick zircon rims may preserve a rich history of metamorphic and post-metamorphic events that can be dated using SIMS U-Pb depth profiling techniques.", "authors": ["Sarah H.

Our results demonstrate that the concentrations and ratios of elements in apatites from different granitoid rocks show distinct features, and are sensitive to magma evolution, petrogenetic and metallogenetic processes. Apatites in the rocks associated with Mo‐W deposits have high content of F and MnO, low content of Cl, which may be indicative of sedimentary sources, while apatites from a Pb‐Zn deposit show relatively high content of Cl and low F content, which possibly suggest a high water content. In these apatites, Sr contents decrease, while Mn and Y contents increase with magma evolution. This relationship reflects that these elements in apatites are related with the degree of magmatic differentiation. Four types of REE patterns in apatites are identified. Type 1 character of highest (La/Yb) N in apatites of Aktogai porphyry Cu‐Mo deposit, Sayak‐I skarn Cu deposit and Akzhal skarn Pb‐Zn depposit is likely produced by the crystallization of heavy REE‐enriched minerals. Type 2 character of upward‐convex light REE in apatite of Aktogai porphyries likely results from La‐enriched mineral crystallization. Type 3 feature of Nd depletion in apatites of East Kounrad and Zhanet deposits both from Mo‐W deposits primarily inherits the character of host‐rock. Type 4 apatites of Aktogai deposit and Akshatau W‐Mo deposit with wide range of REE contents may suggest that apatites crystallize under a wide temperature range. Three types of apatite with distinct redox states are identified based on Eu anomaly. The Aktogai apatite with slight negative Eu anomaly displays the most oxidized state of the magma, and the apatites of other samples at Aktogai, East Kounrad and Akzhal with moderate negative Eu anomaly show moderate oxidizing condition of these rocks, while the remaining apatites with strong En anomaly indicate a moderate reductive state of these rocks.", "authors": ["Ming‐Jian Cao", "Guangming Li", "Kezhang Qin", "Eleonora Seitmuratova", "Yongsheng Liu"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1751-3928.2011.00180.x", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-3928.2011.00180.x", "published": "2011-12-27T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Resource Geology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "哈萨克斯坦中部花岗岩类中磷灰石的主量和微量元素特征：对岩石成因和矿化的指示意义", "domain": "矿床学与成矿", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在通过研究中亚花岗岩中磷灰石的元素特征，揭示岩浆成因和成矿作用。", "methodology": "采用电子探针显微分析和激光剥蚀电感耦合等离子体质谱技术。", "key_findings": "磷灰石元素特征、稀土模式和Eu异常揭示了岩浆演化、岩石成因、成矿过程和氧化还原状态。", "innovation": "首次详细利用中亚花岗岩中磷灰石的元素特征，作为岩浆演化、岩石成因和成矿作用的敏感指示剂。", "relevance_note": "本研究为花岗岩成因和相关矿床形成机制提供了新见解，对矿产勘探具有重要指导意义。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1144/0016-76492010-073", "title": "Pressure–temperature evolution and thermal regimes in the Barrovian zones, Scotland", "abstract": "Abstract: We constrain the P – T evolution of the Barrovian metamorphic zones from the southwestern to the northeastern coasts of Scotland using thermobarometry and pseudosection analysis based on mineral composition data, garnet zoning profiles and 2D garnet maps. Twenty-five samples were investigated from the garnet to the sillimanite zones. In the western half of the field area there was relatively high- P metamorphism (0.9–1.1 GPa) followed by near-isothermal decompression. In and around the Barrovian type area of Glen Clova maximum pressures were also high ( c . 0.8–0.9 GPa); however, peak- T conditions were driven by a brief (of the order of 1 Ma or less) thermal pulse or pulses during exhumation at c . 0.6 GPa. Pressures at peak- T conditions along the eastern coast were the lowest observed, c . 0.4–0.5 GPa. These rocks were probably affected by the same thermal pulse activity evident around Glen Clova. All three regions initially developed during regional metamorphism associated with thermal relaxation of tectonically overthickened crust. The eastern part of the sequence, including Glen Clova, is fundamentally different from the western part because it required additional advective heat input to achieve peak thermal conditions. This heat was probably supplied by synorogenic magmas (e.g. Newer Gabbros) and the associated elevated crustal heat flow.

The three profiles are perpendicular to two veins cutting the Wepawaug Schist, Connecticut, U.S.A., which underwent Barrovian-style metamorphism during the Acadian orogeny. Selvages are highly aluminous with considerably more kyanite, staurolite, and garnet, and less quartz, plagioclase, and mica, than surrounding wallrocks. Kyanite crystals increase in size toward veins, and reach several centimeters in length within veins. Mass balance analysis indicates 50% silica loss and 34% volume loss from selvages, on average. Silica, transferred locally from selvages to veins, accounts for 40 to 80% of the vein silica; the remainder must have been precipitated from fluids that flowed through the veins during regional devolatilization. Fluid flow also transported elements into the rock mass, which were concentrated in the selvages. Gains of Fe, Mn, Y, and HREE were due to the growth of selvage garnet; Fe, Zn, and Li were sequestered into staurolite. Kyanite, staurolite, and garnet growth resulted in Al mass gains. Destruction of mica (particularly muscovite) and of plagioclase in the selvages resulted in losses of K, Na, Ba, Pb, Sn, and volatiles and losses of Na, Sr, and Eu, respectively.

Thus the U-Pb age data of inherited zircons from peraluminous granites provide insights into provenance of clastic sediments in their source region, as do the detrital zircons from sedimentary rocks (and their metamorphosed equivalents). This paper reports the whole-rock geochemical and zircon U-Pb geochronological data (95 analyses) of the Early Jurassic peraluminous granites in the central Lhasa subterrane. These data, in combination with the existing data of inherited zircons (104 analyses) from the Permian and Late Triassic peraluminous granites currently available in the central Lhasa subterrane, are used to characterize the inherited zircon signature of the Lhasa Terrane. These granites belong to strongly peraluminous S-type granites, which contain abundant inherited zircons that define two main age populations of 1250~1100Ma (peak at 1181±14Ma) and 550~450Ma (peak at 494±7Ma), comparable to the ca. 1170Ma age population defined by detrital zircons from Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and the emplacement timing of Cambrian volcanic rocks in the Lhasa Terrane, respectively. The ca. 1170Ma age population defined by inherited and detrital zircons in the Lhasa Terrane differs significantly from the age distributions (peak at ca. 960Ma) defined by detrital zircons from Neoproterozoic-Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the western Qiangtang, Amdo, and Tethyan Hiamalaya in southern Tibet. We propose that the ca. 1181Ma inherited zircons from peraluminous granites in the central Lhasa subterrane were most likely derived from the Albany-Fraser orogenic belt in southwestern Australia and Wilkes Province in East Antarctica, as do the coeval detrital zircons from Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the Lhasa Terrane, and that the ca. 494Ma inherited zircons might have been sourced from both the Western Australia and Lhasa Terrane itself. This paper provides evidence of U-Pb dating on inherited zircons from peraluminous granites for the paleogeographic connection between the Lhasa Terrane and northern Australia. Our studies on the geology of the Lhasa Terrane indicate that a combined in-situ U-Pb dating on inherited zircons from peraluminous granites and detrital zircons from Paleozoic sedimentary rocks can provide important constraints on paleogeography and tectonomagmatic evolution of other microcontinents along the northern margin of Gondwana.", "authors": ["Di‐Cheng Zhu", "Zhidan Zhao", "Yaoling Niu", "Q.

The aim of this study was to determine whether protamine sulfate-coated calcium phosphate (PS-CaP) could stabilize particle size and enhance transfection efficiency.Methods: pEGFP-C1 green fluorescence protein was employed as an indicator of transfection efficiency. Atomic force microscopy was used to evaluate the morphology and the size of the particles, and an MTT assay was introduced to detect cell viability and inhibition. The classical calcium phosphate method was used as the control.Results: Atomic force microscopy images showed that the PS-CaP were much smaller than classical calcium phosphate particles. In 293 FT, HEK 293, and NIH 3T3 cells, the transfection efficiency of PS-CaP was higher than for the classical calcium phosphate particles. The difference in efficiencies implies that the smaller nanoparticles may promote the delivery of DNA into cells through endocytosis and could improve transfection efficiency. In addition, PS-CaP could be used to transfect HEK 293 cells after one week of storage at 4&amp;deg;C with a lesser extent of efficiency loss compared with classical calcium phosphate, indicating that protamine sulfate may increase the stability of calcium phosphate nanoparticles.

RAPD was applied for amplification of DNA samples from healthy controls and patients with pancreatic cancer under the same conditions to determine the different surplus quantity of dGTP in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), thereby determining the difference/quantity of PCR products or template strands. Using this method we generated a genetic fingerprint map of pancreatic cancer through the combination of electrochemical sensors and gel electrophoresis to screen for genetic alterations. Cloning and sequencing were then performed to verify these gene alterations.Results: dGTP showed favorable electrochemical behavior on the MWNTs/GCE. The results indicated that the electrical signal and dGTP had a satisfactory linear relationship with the dGTP concentration within the conventional PCR concentration range. The MWNTs/GCE could distinguish between different products of RAPD.

Molybdenite–chalcopyrite mineralization of the deposit mainly occurs as veinlets in stockwork ore and dissemination in breccia ore, and two ore‐bearing quartz veins crop out to the south of the granite porphyry stock. Based on crosscutting relationships and mineral paragenesis, three hydrothermal stages are identified: (i) quartz–pyrite–molybdenite ± chalcopyrite stage; (ii) pyrite–quartz ± sphalerite stage; and (iii) quartz–calcite ± pyrite ± fluorite stage. Three types of fluid inclusions in the stockwork and breccia ore are recognized: LV, two‐phase aqueous inclusions (liquid‐rich); LVS, three‐phase liquid, vapor, and salt daughter crystal inclusions; and VL, two‐phase aqueous inclusions (gas‐rich). LV and LVS fluid inclusions are recognized in vein ore. Microthermometric investigation of the three types of fluid inclusions in hydrothermal quartz from the stockwork, breccia, and vein ores shows salinities from 1.57 to 66.75 wt% NaCl equivalents, with homogenization temperatures varying from 114°C to 550°C. The temperature changed from 282–550°C, 220–318°C to 114–243°C from the first stage to the third stage. The homogenization temperatures and salinity of the LV, LVS and VL inclusions are 114–442°C and 1.57–14.25 wt% NaCl equivalent, 301–550°C and 31.01–66.75 wt% NaCl equivalent, 286–420°C and 4.65–11.1 wt% NaCl equivalent, respectively. The VL inclusions coexist with the LV and LVS, which homogenize at the similar temperature. The above evidence shows that fluid‐boiling occurred in the ore‐forming stage. δ 34 S values of sulfide from three type ores change from −0.61‰ to 0.86‰. These δ 34 S values of sulfide are similar to δ 34 S values of typical magmatic sulfide sulfur (c. 0‰), suggesting that ore‐forming materials are magmatic in origin.", "authors": ["Qingdong Zeng", "Jianming Liu", "Zuolun Zhang", "Weiqing Zhang", "Shaoxiong Chu", "Song Zhang", "Zaicong Wang", "Xiaoxia Duan"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1751-3928.2011.00161.x", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-3928.2011.00161.x", "published": "2011-06-23T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Resource Geology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "中国东北西拉木伦成矿带车户沟斑岩型钼铜矿床的地质、流体包裹体和硫同位素研究", "domain": "矿床学与成矿", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在阐明车户沟斑岩钼铜矿床的地质特征、流体演化过程及其成矿物质来源。", "methodology": "研究采用了地质学、流体包裹体显微测温和硫同位素分析等方法。", "key_findings": "研究识别出三个热液阶段，证实了流体沸腾现象，并确定了成矿流体具有宽泛的盐度和温度范围，且成矿物质源于岩浆。", "innovation": "本文详细揭示了车户沟斑岩钼铜矿床独特的热液演化过程和成矿流体特征。", "relevance_note": "这项研究有助于深入理解斑岩钼铜矿床的成因机制，并为西拉木伦成矿带的勘探提供指导。"}}]}, {"name": "2010", "count": 30, "works": [{"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1007/s12583-010-0125-x", "title": "Garnet-rich granulite xenoliths from the Hannuoba basalts, North China: Petrogenesis and implications for the Mesozoic crust-mantle interaction", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Yongsheng Liu", "Shan Gao", "Changgui Gao", "Keqing Zong", "Zhaochu Hu", "Wenli Ling"], "doi": "10.1007/s12583-010-0125-x", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12583-010-0125-x", "published": "2010-10-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Earth Science", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "华北汉诺坝玄武岩中的富石榴石麻粒岩捕虏体：岩石成因及其对中生代壳幔相互作用的启示", "domain": "岩石学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在探讨华北汉诺坝玄武岩中富石榴石麻粒岩捕虏体的成因及其对中生代壳幔相互作用的启示。", "methodology": "研究可能采用了岩石学观察、矿物地球化学分析、主微量元素及同位素示踪等方法对捕虏体进行详细研究。", "key_findings": "主要发现可能揭示了富石榴石麻粒岩捕虏体的形成条件、源区特征及其在中生代华北克拉通壳幔相互作用中的作用。", "innovation": "创新点可能在于通过对特定捕虏体的深入研究，提供了华北中生代壳幔相互作用机制的新证据或模型。", "relevance_note": "该研究对理解华北克拉通中生代地壳演化、深部过程以及壳幔相互作用机制具有重要理论和实践意义。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1016/j.epsl.2010.11.001", "title": "A lithium isotopic study of sub-greenschist to greenschist facies metamorphism in an accretionary prism, New Zealand", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Lin Qiu", "Roberta L.

Digestion in mixtures of HF and HNO3 acids is the conventional method of dissolution of geological samples. However, the use of HF is very corrosive and toxic. In this study, decomposition techniques using mixtures of less toxic and safer NH4F and HNO3 in high pressure digestion bombs have been investigated for different types of rock reference materials. Various sample digestion parameters were optimized through the analysis of granite GSR-1 or G-2, which is difficult to dissolve because of presence of resistant minerals like zircon. It was found that the ratio of NH4F(w)/HNO3(v) within the range of 0.33–0.83 has optimum digestion capabilities. Fifty milligrams of granite samples can be completely dissolved by using 0.20–0.50 gram NH4F under given digestion conditions. Our results also indicate that the increase of NH4F/HNO3 ratio or the weighed sample amount or the complete dryness of the treated powders during sample digestion will induce fluoride precipitation. In the case of granites GSR-1 and G-2, the recovery yields of Sc, Y, Sr, REE (excluding Ce) and Th are significantly lower in the presence of fluoride precipitation. The addition of 1–2 ml HNO3 to the treated powder after NH4F/HNO3 attack, before evaporation, can apparently suppress the formation of insoluble fluorides. A digestion time of 10 h in screw top PTFE-lined stainless steel bombs at 190 °C is sufficient to dissolve granite GSR-1. The developed method was applied to the digestion of a series of international geological reference materials. Results obtained using NH4F/HNO3 were similar to published values for mafic to felsic igneous rocks and shale. These results thus show that the NH4F/HNO3 digestion can be used with confidence for a wide variety of geological samples.", "authors": ["Zhaochu Hu", "Shan Gao", "Yongsheng Liu", "Shenghong Hu", "Laishi Zhao", "Yanxiang Li", "Qi Wang"], "doi": "10.1039/b921006g", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1039/b921006g", "published": "2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "NH4F辅助高压消解地质样品用于ICP-MS多元素分析", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在开发一种更安全、毒性更低的替代方法，以取代传统地质样品ICP-MS分析中腐蚀性强的HF酸消解。", "methodology": "研究采用高压消解弹，利用NH4F和HNO3混合物对不同岩石标准物质进行消解，并优化了消解参数。", "key_findings": "发现NH4F(w)/HNO3(v)比在0.33–0.83范围内具有最佳消解能力，且在蒸发前添加HNO3可有效抑制氟化物沉淀，提高元素回收率。", "innovation": "本文创新性地提出并验证了使用NH4F/HNO3混合物作为HF的替代品，用于地质样品的高压消解，显著降低了毒性和腐蚀性。", "relevance_note": "这项研究为地球化学分析提供了一种更安全、高效且可靠的样品前处理方法，对ICP-MS多元素分析领域具有重要价值。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1039/c0ja00145g", "title": "Contrasting matrix induced elemental fractionation in NIST SRM and rock glasses during laser ablation ICP-MS analysis at high spatial resolution", "abstract": "The greatest strength of the LA-ICP-MS technique is its application to microsampling in which extremely small pits are obtained.

The HP metamorphic age of the continental rocks in this zone has not been well constrained, and hence it is not known if they are of the same age as the exhumation of the HP oceanic rocks. In situ laser ablation (multiple collector) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-(MC-)ICP-MS), U–Pb, trace element and Hf isotope analyses were made on zircon in a granitic gneiss and two eclogites from the Huwan shear zone. U–Pb age and trace element analysis of residual magmatic zircon in an eclogite constrain its protolith formation at 411 ± 4 Ma. The zircon in this sample displays εHf (t) values of +6.1 to +14.4. The positive εHf (t) values up to +14.4 suggest that the protolith was derived from a relatively depleted mantle source, most likely Palaeotethyan oceanic crust. A granitic gneiss and the other eclogite yield protolith U–Pb ages of 738 ± 6 and 700 ± 14 Ma, respectively, which are both the Neoproterozoic basement rocks of the Yangtze Block. The zircon in the granitic gneiss has low εHf (t) values of −14.2 to −10.5 and old TDM2 ages of 2528–2298 Ma, suggesting reworking of Palaeoproterozoic crust during the Neoproterozoic. The zircon in the eclogite has εHf (t) values of −1.0 to +7.4 and TDM1 ages of 1294–966 Ma, implying prompt reworking of juvenile crust during its protolith formation. Metamorphic zircon in both eclogite samples displays low Th/U ratios, trace element concentrations, relatively flat heavy rare earth element patterns, weak negative Eu anomalies and low 176Lu/177Hf ratios. All these features suggest that the metamorphic zircon formed in the presence of garnet but in the absence of feldspar, and thus under eclogite facies conditions. The metamorphic zircon yields U–Pb ages of 310 ± 3 and 306 ± 7 Ma. Therefore, both the oceanic- and continental-type eclogites share the same episode of Carboniferous eclogite facies metamorphism.

This study proposes a method to determine twenty trace elements (fourteen rare earth elements, Sc, Y, Zr, Nb, Hf and Ta) by LA‐ICP‐MS directly from polished thick sections and rock slabs of six fine‐grained crystalline and aphanitic rocks (five volcanic rocks and one pelitic tillite). Laser scanning of eight to ten 20 mm long linear tracks using a spot size of 160 μm, with a total ablated area of 26–32 mm 2 , was performed. Quantification was carried out by (a) internal standardisation using Si and (b) without applying internal standardisation. In the latter method, external determination of one element in conventional LA‐ICP‐MS quantification is no longer needed. Although the fine‐grained rocks studied contained variable amounts of volatiles (up to 4%), this method gave results that agree within 10% relative with those obtained by internal standardisation using Si. Two USGS basalt glass reference materials (BCR‐2G and BHVO‐2G) were used for external calibration.

Thermal evolution", "abstract": "This paper presents the results of two-dimensional (2-D) numerical modeling that reconstructs the thermal evolution and the flow of fluid in a collisional overthrust setting with syn-metamorphic magmatism. The goal of the study is to explore the relationships between regional metamorphism and magmatic activity. Our results demonstrate the strong effects that syn-metamorphic magmatism exerts on the thermal structure of the thickened crust. Magmatic intrusions in the form of repetitive sills of mafic or intermediate-felsic compositions introduced at different levels in the thickened crust section may produce Buchan and Barrovian-type metamorphic sequences, as well as rocks in the granulite facies of metamorphism. The peak temperatures in crustal rocks around intrusions are increased by more than 100 °C from their values for the non-magmatic case; the timescales of peak temperature attainment in rocks at short distances from the intrusions are only 1 Myr or less. The peak temperature attainment is synchronous within the different metamorphic zones over the depth range of up to 20 km. These features differ strongly from those in the overthrust model without magmatism, characterized by broad thermal peaks spanning 5 to 10 Myr and non-synchronous attainment of peak conditions for rocks at different depths, with ∼5 Myr delay for every 10 km of depth (exhumation rate = 1 mm yr^−1^). The specific peak metamorphic mineral assemblages that develop in model rock of metapelitic composition as a result of magmatism are largely controlled by the depth of magma emplacement: intrusion into the lower plate of the overthrust zone leads to the development of amphibolite facies mineral assemblages in the staurolite, kyanite and garnet-biotite (without chlorite) zones, as well as considerable volumes of granulite facies rocks. Emplacement of intrusions at mid-crustal depths of 15 to 35 km produces minerals of low-pressure/high-temperature (LP/HT) metamorphic zones, such as cordierite-biotite-K-feldspar, in addition to staurolite, kyanite, and sillimanite zones. When mid-crustal magmatism is initiated at earlier times in the model thrust exhumation history, the LP/HT metamorphic zones may not be preserved in the crustal section due to surface erosion. All of the models predict extremely steep, approximately isobaric Metamorphic Field Temperature Gradients (MFTGs) around the edges of the intrusions and along the contacts of thick isolated sills. In some cases, the transition from chlorite to sillimanite zones of metamorphism at the side of the magmatic region may take place in less than 1 km. The magmatism-related MFTGs stand in contrast to the regional metamorphic gradients produced by crustal thickening that form at the flanks of the overthrust zone distal to the magmas. Here, the transition from the chlorite zone to high-grade mineral assemblages takes place over 20 to 40 km, and the pressure of peak temperature attainment increases by as much as 0.3 GPa from low to high grade.", "authors": ["T.

Fluid flow and implications for Barrovian and Buchan metamorphism, Scotland", "abstract": "This paper presents the results of two-dimensional numerical modeling of crustal fluid flow in a collisional overthrust setting during emplacement of syn-metamorphic mafic sills. An important feature of the fluid flow in the presence of magmatic intrusions is the long-lived prograde up-temperature (up-T) flow of fluid. This upward flow is driven by dehydration reactions in the rocks underlying the intrusions and upward is the consequence of the inverted thermal profile that appears within the depth range of magmatism. If magma is intruded at mid-crustal depths following crustal collision, the up-T flow regime may persist for as much as 5 Myr. Such long-lived up-T fluid flow is not observed in models without magmatism. Strong retrograde reactions in rocks surrounding intrusions may give rise to downward up-temperature flow into the heated but rapidly cooling areas of the crust during exhumation, but the fluid fluxes in these areas are typically small. The total time-integrated fluid fluxes produced by magmatism and crustal overthickening in the middle and deep crust are substantial, in some cases reaching 3,000 m3 m−2 over 35 Myr. Early magmatic events may give rise to fluid fluxes exceeding 1,000 m3 m−2 in only 1 Myr. The strong dehydration that accompanies the emplacement of hot magma into the relatively low-temperature wall rock leads to hydrofracturing of large volumes of crustal rocks surrounding intrusions. The fractured rock region may extend over tens of kilometers from the zone of magma emplacement. More hydrofracturing is predicted for the middle and deep crust than for the shallow crust because of the exponential decrease of crustal permeability with depth that is assumed in our models. Endothermic dehydration, exothermic retrograde hydration, and the latent heat of wall rock fusion can all influence thermal budgets. In the final part of the paper we integrate the results of the fluid flow modeling presented here, the reconstructions of thermal evolution presented in Part I, and field-based data for the type locality of Barrovian and Buchan metamorphism in Scotland. Many key phenomena predicted by our numerical models are observed in the Scottish Dalradian, including the very short thermal peaks attained over a relatively narrow time span across a broad range of metamorphic zones; penecontemporaneous Barrovian, Buchan, and granulite facies metamorphism; steep Metamorphic Field Temperature Gradients (MFTGs) in the vicinity of intrusions; and petrological evidence consistent with up-temperature fluid flow. Our results suggest that some controversial aspects of regional metamorphism in the Scottish Dalradian, including heat transfer processes and the steep MFTGs, may be plausibly explained by the effects of plutonism.", "authors": ["T.

The granitoids (K-feldspar granite and granite porphyry) give Laser-ICPMS zircon U-Pb ages of 354.2±2.3Ma and 339.5±2.3Ma respectively,indicating that the surrounding Dahalajunshan volcanics were formed no later than the earliest stage of the Early Carboniferous. It is proposed that the volcanic rocks of the Dahalajunshan Formation and the Early Carboniferous A-type granites from the Adengtao area in the Southeast Zhaosu were probably formed in a back-arc extensional environment of an active continental margin,based on a combined analysis of the field observations,regional tectonics,and the geochemistry and ages of the rocks.", "authors": ["Jilei Li"],

The loss of heat from the magma causes solidification and crystallization of the magma and the growth of metamorphic minerals in rocks that are heated by the magma. The growth of crystals in the magma and in the metamorphic rocks first involves the formation of nuclei, and then the components needed for crystal growth must diffuse to these nuclei. This occurs through the liquid in the case of magma and through solid rock or films of grain-boundary fluid in the case of metamorphic rocks. As magma crystallizes, the composition of the residual liquid is continuously changing and the composition of crystals must change their composition if they are to remain in equilibrium with the melt. For early formed phenocrysts to adjust their composition, components need to diffuse in and out of the crystals. As the temperature of metamorphic rocks changes, the minerals must adjust their compositions to remain in equilibrium and this again involves diffusion.

The organizing and systematizing of the defined quantities then lead to the development of genetic models that attempt to explain the apparent order revealed by the classification. At this stage, modification of some of the original definitions may improve the classification by simplifying the genetic models. Through such reiterations it is hoped the order in classifications can be made to match more closely the order that presumably exists in nature. Some classifications have approached this goal more closely than others, whereas some have completely failed and are no longer used.

The compositions of these grains are readily explained in terms of thermodynamic phase equilibria, but their growth is controlled by kinetic factors that are still poorly understood. The texture of a rock, which bears testimony to the rock's origin, is determined largely by crystal growth. Grain size, which is also determined by crystal growth, affects the rheology of rocks and, thus, plays important roles in determining flow rates in the mantle, which in turn, affect globally so many other geological processes through plate tectonics. Investigating crystal growth in anything other than a vapor or low-temperature aqueous solution at atmospheric pressure is experimentally difficult. A few studies, however, have shed significant light on high-temperature crystal growth of silicates that operate on the timescale typical of cooling lavas (see reviews by Kirkpatrick, 1975; Lofgren, 1980; Cashman, 1990; and Sunagawa, 1992). Growth rates in plutonic igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks, however, are so slow that they will probably always remain outside the reach of the experimentalist. Only through understanding the principles are we likely to gain insight into these slower growth processes (Dowty, 1980; Brandeis et al., 1984).

Since mineralization is determined by solubility, this mechanism, termed pore‐size controlled solubility (PCS), is potentially significant for the evolution of porosity and permeability during reactive transport. To demonstrate the potential impact in geological systems, we developed a new one‐dimensional numerical model, using a moving boundary condition, to describe the mineralization in the rock matrix adjacent to a pressure solution (stylolite) interface. In the model, the porous domain initially possesses a polymodal pore size distribution, although this is allowed to change in response to mineral precipitation, and the evolution of porosity and pore size distributions was simulated both for systems with constant mineral solubility and for systems in which solubility was pore size controlled. Consistent with field observations, total porosity decreases near the stylolite interface in all the simulations. However, in systems with constant solubility, nanometer‐scale pores close rapidly because of their high specific surface area; by contrast, when the PCS mechanism is included in the model, transient bimodal pore size distributions develop, with nano‐pores remaining open throughout the simulation. Our simulations suggest that the combination of the PCS mechanism with kinetic models for mineral precipitation can account for the bimodal pore size distributions observed in sedimentary carbonate rocks. Furthermore, while the mechanism is unlikely to affect rocks such as sandstones, PCS can impact carbonate and clay‐bearing sediments, which typically possess high levels of submicron porosity.", "authors": ["Simon Emmanuel", "Jay J.

The modeling is intended to test hypotheses regarding the direction of regional fluid flow in the middle and deep crust, including upward, convective, sub-horizontal, up-temperature, and downtemperature flow regimes. Several geological factors that have received relatively little attention in previous numerical models of regional metamorphic fluid flow are considered: (1) retrograde hydration metamorphic reactions; (2) anisotropy and spatial heterogeneity in crustal permeability structure; (3) temporal evolution of permeability as a result of porosity production and consumption during metamorphic reactions; (4) heat of metamorphic reactions. Our results suggest that the typical fluid flow pattern in overthrust settings is towards the surface, in the direction of decreasing temperature. The flow is mainly driven by metamorphic dehydration reactions; the integrated fluxes in the deep crust below 20 km are of the order of 10 3 m 3 /m 2 over 30 Myr for a background permeability of 10 ^19 m 2 . At higher crustal permeability, the buoyancy flux generally exceeds the metamorphic flux and large-scale fluid circulation becomes possible.Transient upward flow in the up-temperature direction is observed during the first 1^3 Myr of the model evolution within the thrust core that undergoes retrograde hydration; this flow is the result of the initially inverted geotherm in the thickened crustal section. Downward fluid infiltration caused by metamorphic hydration may occur in the flanks of the model orogen, but the integrated fluxes in these areas are only � 10 m 3 /m 2 . Hydration-driven downward flow may also develop in the core of the orogen at late stages of exhumation. Low-permeability layers lead to sub-horizontal (but down-temperature) flow over distances corresponding to the lateral dimensions of such layers. Heterogeneities in permeability structure, as well as porosity^permeability variations produced by metamorphic reactions, result in focusing of fluid flow and locally elevated fluid fluxes (up to 10 4 m 3 /m 2 ). These fluxes are large enough to produce significant chemical and isotopic metasomatism, but are not sufficient to significantly affect the temperature distribution in the model orogen. However, metamorphic hydration and dehydration reactions are found to exert considerable control on the regional thermal structure. We conclude that convective, downward, or uptemperature fluid flow is probably very limited during amagmatic prograde metamorphism of the middle and lower crust, even in the presence of permeability anisotropy, high-permeability channels, or low-permeability barriers.", "authors": ["T.

Petrological and geochemical features indicate that these mantle-derived composite xenoliths were formed by silicic melt^lherzolite interaction. The Precambrian zircon ages can be classified into three age groups of 2·4^2·5 Ga, 1·6^2·2 Ga and 0·6^1·2 Ga, coinciding with major geological events in the NCC. These Precambrian zircons fall in the field of continental granitoid rocks in plots of U/Yb vs Hf and Y. Their igneous-type REE patterns and metamorphic zircon type CL images indicate that they were not crystallized during melt^peridotite interaction and subsequent high-pressure metamorphism.The 2·5 Ga zircons have positive eHf(t) values (2·9^10·6), whereas the younger Precambrian zircons are dominated by negative eHf(t) values, indicating an ancient continental crustal origin.These observations suggest that the Precambrian zircons were xenocrysts that survived melting of recycled continental crustal rocks and were then injected with silicate melt into the host peridotite. In addition to the Precambrian zircons, igneous zircons of 315 3 Ma (2 ), 80^170 Ma and 48^64 Ma were separated from the garnet/spinel pyroxenite veins; these provide evidence for lower continental crust and oceanic crust recycling-induced multi-episodic melt^peridotite interactions in the central zone of the NCC. The combination of the positive eHf(t) values (2·91^24·6) of the 315 Ma zircons with the rare occurrence of 302^324 Ma subduction-related diorite^granite plutons in the northern margin of the NCC implies that the 315 Ma igneous zircons might record melt^peridotite interactions in the lithospheric mantle induced by Palaeo-Asian oceanic crust subduction. Igneous zircons of age 80^170 Ma generally coexist with the Precambrian metamorphic zircons and have lower Ce/Yb and Th/U ratios, higher U/Yb ratios and greater negative Eu anomalies.The eHf(t) values of these zircons vary greatly from ^47·6 to 24·6.The 170^110 Ma zircons are generally characterized by negative eHf(t) values, whereas the 110^100 Ma zircons have positive eHf(t) values.These observations suggest that melt^peridotite interactions at 80^170 Ma were induced by partial melting of recycled continental crust. The 48^64 Ma igneous zircons are characterized by negligible Ce anomalies, unusually high REE, U and Th contents, and positive eHf(t) values.These features imply that the melt^peridotite interactions at 48^64 Ma could be associated with a depleted mantle-derived carbonate melt or fluid.", "authors": ["Yongsheng Liu", "Shunbao Gao", "Zhaoping Hu", "Chengjin Gao", "Keqing Zong", "Dongyan Wang"], "doi": "10.1093/petrology/egp082", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egp082", "published": "2009-12-16T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Petrology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06", "followed_author": "刘勇胜"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "华北横向造山带中大陆和洋壳再循环诱导的熔体-橄榄岩相互作用：地幔捕虏体锆石的U-Pb定年、Hf同位素和微量元素研究", "domain": "岩石学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "Investigates multi-episodic melt-peridotite interactions induced by continental and oceanic crust recycling in the Trans-North China Orogen.", "methodology": "Employed U-Pb dating, Hf isotopes, and trace element analysis on zircons from mantle xenoliths.", "key_findings": "Identified Precambrian xenocrystic zircons and multi-episodic igneous zircons (315 Ma, 80-170 Ma, 48-64 Ma) linked to diverse crustal recycling mechanisms.", "innovation": "First finding of continental crust-derived Precambrian zircons in mantle xenoliths from the central North China Craton.", "relevance_note": "Offers critical insights into deep crustal recycling processes and mantle evolution, contributing to understanding craton destruction in the North China Craton."}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1111/j.1525-1314.2009.00826.x", "title": "Zircon U–Pb age, trace element and Hf isotope composition of Kongling terrane in the Yangtze Craton: refining the timing of Palaeoproterozoic high‐grade metamorphism", "abstract": "Abstract U–Pb age, trace element and Hf isotope compositions of zircon were analysed for a metasedimentary rock and two amphibolites from the Kongling terrane in the northern part of the Yangtze Craton.

The 2D model is used to explore feedbacks between the thermal structure and exhumation history of a collisional terrane and the metamorphic reaction progress. The results for average values of crustal and mantle heat production in a model with metapelitic crust composition predict a 25–40 °C decrease in metamorphic peak temperatures due to dehydration reactions; the maximum difference between the P–T–t paths of reacting and non‐reacting rocks is 35–45 °C. The timing of the thermal peak is delayed by 2–4 Myr, whereas pressure at peak temperature conditions is decreased by more than 0.2 GPa. The changes in temperature and pressure caused by reaction may lead to considerable differences in prograde reaction pathways; the consumption of heat during dehydration may produce greenschist facies mineral assemblages in rocks that would have otherwise attained amphibolite facies conditions in the absence of reaction enthalpy. The above effects, although significant, are produced by relatively limited metamorphic reaction which liberates only half of the water available for dehydration over the lifetime of the prograde metamorphism. The limited reaction is due to the lack of heat in a model with the average thermal structure and relatively fast erosion, a common outcome in the numerical modelling of Barrovian metamorphism. This problem is typically resolved by invoking additional heat sources, such as high radiogenic heat production, elevated mantle heating or magmatism. Several models are tested that incorporate additional radiogenic heat sources; the elevated heating rates lead to stronger reaction and correspondingly larger thermal effects of metamorphism. The drop in peak temperatures may exceed 45 °C, the maximum temperature differences between the reacting and non‐reacting P–T–t paths may reach 60 °C, and pressure at peak temperature conditions is decreased by more than 0.2 GPa. Field observations suggest that devolatilization of metacarbonate rocks can also exert controls on metamorphic temperatures. Enthalpies were calculated for the reaction progress recorded by metacarbonate rocks in Vermont, and were used in models that include a layer of mixed metapelite–metacarbonate composition. A model with the average thermal structure and erosion rate of 1 mm year −1 can provide only half of the heat required to drive decarbonation reactions in a 10 km thick mid‐crustal layer containing 50 wt% of metacarbonate rock. Models with elevated heating rates, on the other hand, facilitated intensive devolatilization of the metacarbonate‐bearing layer. The reactions resulted in considerable changes in the model P–T–t paths and ∼60 °C drop in metamorphic peak temperatures. Our results suggest that metamorphic reactions can play an important role in the thermal evolution of collisional settings and are likely to noticeably affect metamorphic P–T–t paths, peak metamorphic conditions and crustal geotherms. Decarbonation reactions in metacarbonate rocks may lead to even larger effects than those observed for metapelitic rocks. Endothermic effects of prograde reactions may be especially important in collisional settings containing additional heat sources and thus may pose further challenges for the ‘missing heat’ problem of Barrovian metamorphism.", "authors": ["T.

Thirty‐eight samples of veins, selvages and precursors were collected, examined using the petrographic microscope and electron microprobe, and geochemically analysed. With increasing grade, typical precursor mineral assemblages include, but are not limited to, chlorite+chloritoid, chlorite+chloritoid+kyanite, chlorite+chloritoid+staurolite and garnet+staurolite+kyanite+chloritoid. These assemblages coexist with quartz, white mica (muscovite, paragonite, margarite), and Fe‐Ti oxides. The mineral assemblage of the selvages does not change noticeably with metamorphic grade, and consists of chloritoid, kyanite, chlorite, quartz, white mica and Fe‐Ti oxides. Pseudosections for selvage and precursor bulk compositions indicate that the observed mineral assemblages were stable at regional metamorphic conditions of 550–600 °C and 0.8–1.1 GPa. A mass balance analysis was performed to assess the nature and magnitude of geochemical alteration that produced the selvages adjacent to the veins. On average, selvages lost about −26% mass relative to precursors. Mass losses of Na, K, Ca, Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba and volatiles were −30 to −60% and resulted from the destruction of white mica. Si was depleted from most selvages and transported locally to adjacent veins; average selvage Si losses were about −50%. Y and rare earth elements were added due to the growth of monazite in cracks cutting apatite. The mass balance analysis also suggests some addition of Ti occurred, consistent with the presence of rutile and hematite‐ilmenite solid solutions in veins. No major losses of Al from selvages were observed, but Al was added in some cases. Consequently, the Al needed to precipitate vein kyanite was not derived locally from the selvages. Veins more than an order of magnitude thicker than those typically observed in the field would be necessary to accommodate the Na and K lost from the selvages during alteration. Therefore, regional transport of Na and K out of the local rock system is inferred. In addition, to account for the observed abundances of kyanite in the veins, large fluid‐rock ratios (10 2 –10 3 m 3 fluid m −3 rock ) and time‐integrated fluid fluxes in excess of ∼10 4 m 3 fluid m −2 rock are required owing to the small concentrations of Al in aqueous fluids. It is concluded that the quartz‐kyanite veins and their selvages were produced by regional‐scale advective mass transfer by means of focused fluid flow along a thrust fault zone. The results of this study provide field evidence for considerable Al mass transport at greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphic conditions, possibly as a result of elevated concentrations of Al in metamorphic fluids due to alkali‐Al silicate complexing at high pressures.", "authors": ["Claire E.

The method used involved external calibration against GOR132‐G for Ir and NIST SRM 610 for other elements, internal standardisation using Ca, and ablation with a crater diameter of 160 μm and a pulsed laser repetition rate of 10 Hz. Small amounts of nitrogen (5 ml min −1 ) were added to the central channel gas of the plasma to improve the limits of detection for most of these elements by a factor of 1.2–2.5 and to reduce the oxide interference level to 0.02% (ThO + /Th + ). Under these conditions, the LODs for most of these rarely determined elements were within the range 0.1 to 10 ng g −1 . The operating conditions that were required to minimise ICP‐induced fractionation (U + /Th + ≈ 1) in the mode without nitrogen were accompanied by a 50–60% reduction in sensitivity for elements such as Ca, Au and Pt. In contrast, ICP‐induced fractionation could be minimised (U + /Th + ≈ 1) with no loss of analyte sensitivity in the nitrogen mode. Interferences of CuAr + , ZnAr + , Cd + , Pb 2+ and Sn + on Pd + , Rh + , Cd + and In + were corrected. Oxide interferences were not considered due to their lower production rate. Analytical precision, as given by one relative standard deviation (% RSD) was less than 15% for most of the elements present at concentrations greater than 0.1 μg g −1 . A significant negative correlation was found between logarithmic concentration and logarithmic RSD, with a correlation coefficient of −0.76. This trend indicates that possible chemical heterogeneities for most of these elements are smaller than the analytical uncertainty.

In this paper, we report an integrated study of mineral inclusion, trace-element, U-Pb age, and Lu-Hf isotope compositions of hydrothermal zircon grains from a quartz vein within an UHP eclogite outcrop from the Hong'an area, western Dabie Mountains. These data are used to decipher the age, conditions of formation, and source of fluid for zircon formation during the exhumation of UHP rocks. Zircon grains from the vein have perfect euhedral shape, and show sector zoning or weak zoning, indicating that they precipitated from the aqueous fluid responsible for the vein formation. Raman spectroscopy analysis reveals that the zircon grains contain inclusions of garnet, omphacite, rutile, quartz, and H2O, implying that they crystallized from aqueous fluid under HP eclogite-facies conditions. The zircon grains show low Th/U and Lu/Hf ratios, nearly flat HREE patterns, absent Eu anomalies and low LREE contents. These characteristics are consistent with their precipitation in the presence of garnet and epidote, and absence of feldspar, and thus suggest that trace-element concentrations in hydrothermal zircon are controlled by co-precipitation of mineral assemblages. Crystallization temperatures of 670 to 712 °C, which were calculated using the Ti content of zircon, are consistent with their formation under eclogitefacies conditions and may correspond to the temperature of the infiltrating fluid. The weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 224.7 ± 1.3 Ma is taken as the best estimate for the age of quartz-vein formation and records aqueous fluid flow during the early exhumation stage of UHP rocks. The zircon grains in the quartz-vein have Hf compositions similar to those in the host eclogite, which demonstrates isotopic equilibrium between fluid and rocks and that the fluid-rock ratio was likely low.", "authors": ["Yanshuang Wu", "Shan Gao", "H.-F.

On the other hand, Nb and Ta could be ”lost” in diluted nitric acid solution due to hydrolysis. Our routine analyses of geological samples digested with PTFE Bomb (HF+ HNO3) indicate that these elements were not always lost during sample preparation, which implies that stabilities of Nb and Ta were controlled by some components in addition to HF. In this work, several experiments were conducted to investigate the specific behavior of Nb and Ta during sample digestion with PTFE Bomb for ICP-MS analysis. The results indicate that major metal components (e.g., Al, Fe, Mg, and Ca) in rocks could play a comparable role in stabilizing Nb and Ta species. Ta in diluted nitric acid solution (i.e.2% HNO3) could be stabilized by concentrated metal cation (e.g., Al/Ta ＞ 104), which are consistent with the generally good results of routine analyses of geological samples. Alternatively, enough amounts of HF could prevent hydrolysis of Ta in diluted nitric acid solution as well to obtain satisfactory recovery. Nb shows different chemical behavior from Ta during the chemical preparation for ICP-MS analysis. Ta is more easily hydrolyzed/polymerized than Nb in diluted nitric acid solution.

crust are of great interest in understanding the dynamic processes of the Earth interior. In this study, we examined relationships between the magnetic properties and opaque mineralogy of a set of mafic granulite xenoliths (derived from ∼24–41 km) collected from the Hannuoba region, north China (a region well known for its exposures of lower crustal rocks). These mafic granulite xenoliths are weakly magnetic with an average magnetic susceptibility ( χ , mass specific) and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) of 5.87 × 10 −7 m 3 kg −1 and 31.53 × 10 −4 Am 2 kg −1 , respectively. The opaque minerals identified by electron microprobe (EMP) analysis in mafic granulite xenoliths are mainly paramagnetic Mg‐rich ilmenite, which significantly contributed the room temperature χ . In contrast, SIRM are controlled predominately by pyrrhotite and magnetite, which were clearly identified by both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and rock magnetic analyses. Our results show some relationships between these magnetic properties and the ratio of concentrations of the trace rare earth elements (La/Yb), which is sensitive to degree of fractional crystallization. More significantly, the Mg content in ilmenite is highly related to the fractional crystallization.

Therefore, aerosol expansion related changes in the composition of aerosols generated using a 193 nm excimer laser were studied within the ablation cell using an in-cell aerosol extraction strategy. The gas flow pattern within the ablation cell in the proposed local aerosol extraction was modelled using computational fluid dynamics techniques. Compared to commonly applied ablation cell geometry, the peak height of a single laser shot was increased by a factor of 13.5, the signal width was reduced by a factor of 12 and the washout time of the sample cell was consequently shortened to approx. 2 s, thereby almost eliminating processes of aerosol recirculation within the cell. The selective extraction of aerosol from different positions of the expanding laser plume was realized by subsequently changing the sampling distance between the ablation site and the gas outlet nozzle tip. The results show a similar distribution of siderophile elements (P, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ga, Ge, Mo, W, Au), chalcophile elements (Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rh, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, Pt, Tl, Pb, Bi) and some of lithophile elements (Li, B, Na, Mg, Si, K, V, Rb, Ba, U) within the expanding plume. In contrast, lithophile elements Be, Al, Ca, Sc, Y, Zr, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Hf, Ta and Th were significantly depleted towards increasing sampling distances from the ablation site. Furthermore, the plume composition depends strongly on the ambient gas used within the ablation cell. Evaluating various physical properties of individual elements it becomes clear that no single parameter dependence exists. However, elements with oxide melting points higher than 1500 °C tend to be depleted towards cooler regions of the expanding aerosol. The proposed local aerosol extraction strategy is suitable for the identification of position dependent and, therefore, an indirect indicator for particle size dependent elemental composition of 193 nm laser generated aerosols under He atmosphere, which could not be studied using particle separation devices. In contrast to the ablation in helium, the changes of the aerosol composition in argon were less variable amongst different elements when sampling at different distances from the ablation crater. However, Zn and Cd intensities increased when sampling further away from the ablation crater.

This result is inconsistent with most geodynamic models of crustal over‐thickening and conductive heating, wherein rocks which reach different metamorphic grades generally reach peak temperatures at different times. Instead, the presence of additional sources of heat and/or focusing mechanisms for heat transport, such as magmatic intrusions and/or advection by metamorphic fluids, may have contributed to the contemporaneous development of several different metamorphic zones. Here, we test the hypothesis of temporally focussed heating for the Wepawaug Schist, a Barrovian terrane in Connecticut, USA, using Sm–Nd ages of prograde garnet growth and U–Pb zircon crystallization ages of associated igneous rocks. Peak temperature in the biotite–garnet zone was dated (via Sm–Nd on garnet) at 378.9 ± 1.6 Ma (2σ), whereas peak temperature in the highest grade staurolite–kyanite zone was dated (via Sm–Nd on garnet rims) at 379.9 ± 6.8 Ma (2σ). These garnet ages suggest that peak metamorphism was pene‐contemporaneous (within error) across these metamorphic grades. Ion microprobe U–Pb ages for zircon from igneous rocks hosted by the metapelites also indicate a period of syn‐metamorphic peak igneous activity at 380.6 ± 4.7 Ma (2σ), indistinguishable from the peak ages recorded by garnet. A 388.6 ± 2.1 Ma (2σ) garnet core age from the staurolite–kyanite zone indicates an earlier episode of growth (coincident with ages from texturally early zircon and a previously published monazite age) along the prograde regional metamorphic T – t path. The timing of peak metamorphism and igneous activity, as well as the occurrence of extensive syn‐metamorphic quartz vein systems and pegmatites, best supports the hypothesis that advective heating driven by magmas and fluids focussed major mineral growth into two distinct episodes: the first at c. 389 Ma, and the second, corresponding to the regionally synchronous peak metamorphism, at c. 380 Ma.", "authors": ["Penelope J.

Measured Nb and Ta values of MPI‐DING glasses were found to be consistently lower than the recommended values by about 15% and 25%, respectively, if calibration was undertaken using commonly accepted values of NIST SRM 610 given by Pearce et al. Analytical precision, as given by the 1 s relative standard deviation (% RSD) was less than 10% for Nb and Ta at concentrations higher than 0.1 μg g −1 . A significant negative correlation was found between logarithmic concentration and logarithmic RSD, with correlation coefficients of ‐0.94 for Nb and ‐0.96 for Ta. This trend indicates that the analytical precision follows counting statistics and thus most of the measurement uncertainty was analytical in origin and not due to chemical heterogeneities. Large differences between measured and expected Nb and Ta in glasses GOR128‐G and GOR132‐G are likely to have been caused by the high RSDs associated with their very low concentrations. However, this cannot explain the large differences between measured and expected Nb and Ta in other MPI‐DING glasses, since the differences are normally higher than RSD by a factor of 3. Count rates for Nb and Ta, normalised to Ca sensitivity, for the MPI‐DING, USGS and NIST SRM 612–614 glasses were used to construct calibration curves for determining NIST SRM 610 concentrations at crater diameters ranging from 16 (im to 60 μm. The excellent correlation between the Nb/Ca 1μgg‐1 signal (Nb represents the Nb signal intensity; Ca 1μg g‐1 represents the Ca sensitivity) and Nb concentration, and between the Ta/Ca 1μg g‐1 signal (where Ta represents the Ta signal intensity; Ca 1μg g‐1 represents the Ca sensitivity) and Ta concentration (R 2 = 0.9992–1.00) in the various glass matrices suggests that matrix‐dependent fractionation for Nb, Ta and Ca was insignificant under the given instrumental conditions. The results confirm that calibration reference values of Nb and Ta in NIST SRM 610 given by Pearce et al. are about 16% and 28% lower, respectively. We thus propose a revision of the preferred value for Nb from 419.4 ± 57.6 μg g −1 to 485 ± 5 μg g −1 (1 s) and for Ta from 376.6 ± 77.6 μg g −1 to 482 ± 4 μg g −1 (Is) in NIST SRM 610.

Fluid–wall-rock interaction resulted in the development of spectacular alteration selvedges, in the immediate vicinity of the pegmatites, in adjacent Archaean orthogneisses. Archaean wall-rocks affected by the infiltration of aqueous fluids show contrasting patterns of K, Na and Ca metasomatism, which we demonstrate was fundamentally controlled by disequilibrium of invading fluids with wall-rock feldspars, rather than fluid flow up or down regional pressure or temperature gradients. Other species, such as the rare earth elements (REE; except Eu), Y, P, Rb, Th, U and Pb, for example, show significant enrichment in the metasomatized wall-rock in both examples studied. Enrichment of P (and Y), sympathetic with that of REE enrichment, is consistent with recent suggestions that REE transport in fluids may be enhanced by complexing with dissolved P and Y compounds. Dehydration and partial melting of previously unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks, underthrust beneath the SW Napier Complex, has been long considered a viable source for felsic pegmatites (and associated fluids) observed in that region.

While the average precision and signal intensities were found no significant change in presence and in absence of the DBD device for the 213 nm LA-ICP-MS. No obvious change was obtained for the elemental fractionation index in the 193 nm laser ablation system with the DBD device. The elemental fractionation index was closer to 1 with the DBD for 213 nm LA-ICP-MS. The results demonstrate the elemental fractionation effect was inhibited availably with the DBD device.", "authors": ["张路远", "胡圣虹", "胡兆初", "胡明月", "G. E.

Based on estimates of the rate of seafloor spreading and the degree of serpentinization within the oceanic crust, the flux of methane generated by serpentinized lithosphere is calculated to be ∼1.35 Mt CH 4 y −1 , while volcanic and geothermal sources are estimated to contribute ∼0.1 and ∼0.9 Mt CH 4 y −1 , respectively.

Here, we describe data from two Barrovian metamorphic terranes which test this idea. In the Barrovian zones of Scotland, garnet Sm/Nd geochronology from the garnet and sillimanite zones yield the same peak metamorphic ages [1] (~465 Ma). The age is similar to the age of crystallization of large igneous bodies in the area. The contemporaneity of peak ages is explained by an efficient, advective component of heating, perhaps mediated by synchronous fluid flow [2]. The duration of this regionwide pulse of peak metamorphism is constrained by new Srin-apatite diffusion modeling. Apatite grains have detrital cores and metamorphic overgrowths and are included within porphyroblasts (e.g. garnet, staurolite). Modeling of intragrain diffusion of Sr constrains the duration of peak metamorphism to <250 kyr for garnet through staurolite zone samples. Garnet multi-component diffusion modeling from the sillimanite zone corroborates this brief pulse duration. The Wepawaug Schist of Connecticut USA, also yields contemporaneous peak-T garnet Sm/Nd ages from different grades across the terrane (~380 Ma). This age matches a population of texturally young zircons associated with igneous intrusions in these rocks. Garnet cores from the kyanite zone, which have growth textures indicative of extremely rapid growth [3], have been dated by Sm/Nd at 388.6 Ma. This age is matched by another population of zircons also associated with igneous intrusions. This earlier prograde growth event may be related to another pulse of metamorphic growth, brought on by magmatic fluid and heat. Brief pulses of metamorphic heating and mineral reactions, perhaps catalyzed by the introduction of fluids, may be superimposed on regional scale conductive heating at tectonic rates. Such short pulses could help explain the discrepancy between rapid lab-based reaction kinetics and much slower time-integrated field-based reaction kinetics [4].", "authors": ["Ethan F.

Both the picrites and basalts contain xenocrystic olivines with high Fo92-93 and low CaO (b0.10%), consistent with the lavas' derivation from, or interaction with Archean mantle lithosphere. Most importantly, both the picritic and basaltic lavas contain unusual, reversely zoned clinopyroxene phenocrysts whose cores have low MgO, high Na2O (up to 2.4 wt.%, or 17.3 mol% Jd), and frequently contain ilmenite exsolution lamellae, consistent with their crystallization from an eclogite-derived melt (tonalite or trondhjemite). In contrast, the clinopyroxene exteriors have low Na2 O( b0.92 wt.%, or b6.5 mol% Jd) and are lamellae-free, suggesting crystallization from a mantle-derived melt (picrite or basalt). Both the cores and exteriors have high Al2O3 contents (up to 6.9 wt.%). These features reflect crystallization of the cpx from an aluminous melt at mantle depths, with the cores forming at a significantly greater depth (≥2.5 GPa) than the surrounding cpx (≥1.5 GPa). Calculated primary melt compositions further constrain the magmas' formation at 3-4 GPa, in the presence of garnet. The unusually low CaO, high Ni/MgO and low 100Mn/Fe of primary melts indicate derivation of both the picritic and basaltic lavas from pyroxenite sources containing limited or no olivine. High Sr/Y, LaN/YbN and Th/U and low Lu/Hf, together with radiogenic initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios and negative eNd values implicate contributions from melts derived from foundered eclogitic lower continental crust. Modelling suggests that the basalt source region contained a variable proportion (30-40%) of eclogite-derived component whereas the source of the picrites, on average, likely contained a generally higher proportion (60-70%) of a different eclogite-derived component. Collectively, these results suggest that both the basaltic and picritic lavas originated by partial melting of Archean lithospheric mantle that was variably hybridised by melts derived from foundered lower crustal eclogite. Together with previous studies, these findings provide new evidence that thinning of the North China craton was caused by the removal of the lower lithosphere (mantle and lower crust). Recycling and melting of eclogitic lower crust may contribute more to mantle heterogeneity than has previously been recognized.", "authors": ["Shan Gao", "Roberta L.

We use Monte Carlo simulations of crystal growth morphologies to assess chemical disequilibrium during deep crustal (25–35 km) garnet crystallization (Connecticut, USA). Initial garnet growth produced crystals with poorly developed crystal faces and/or branched, dendritic forms. This growth phase occurred after equilibrium conditions for devolatilization reactions were considerably overstepped during metamorphic heating as a result of energy barriers to garnet nucleation. Mineral compositions and assemblages may have been unable to track evolving P-T-X histories during both the period of overstepping when no reaction was occurring, and when reactions began far from chemical equilibrium. Growth during the overstepped stage must therefore preserve valuable information about the kinetic history of metamorphism, and could have released considerable volatiles, leading to rock weakening and potentially hydrofracturing. The position of regional garnet isograds in the study area may have been strongly dependent on the kinetics of garnet nucleation and growth, rather than the equilibrium P-T-X conditions for garnet-forming reactions.

The primary mineral assemblage of garnet + omphacite/augite + quartz + rutile ± pargasite of the eclogite and garnet clinopyroxenite xenoliths defines a minimum pressure of >1.5 GPa, while the estimated peak metamorphic temperatures range from 800 to 1060 °C. An Sm-Nd whole-rock–garnet isochron and zircon U-Pb dates show that timing of the eclogite facies metamorphism took place ca. 220 Ma. This Triassic age agrees with the age of eclogites from the Dabie-Sulu ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic (UHPM) belt. The ages of abundant Late Archean to early Paleoproterozoic (2.3–2.6Ga) inherited zircons correspond to the most prominent crustal growth event in the North China craton. In addition, these xenoliths and their host high-Mg adakitic intrusions have complementary major and trace element compositions, suggesting that the adakites formed by partial melting of Archean metabasalts that were the protoliths of the Xu-Huai eclogite and garnet clinopyroxenite xenoliths. Trace element and Sr-Nd isotopic modeling shows that the high-Mg adakitic intrusions can be modeled as melts from ∼40% partial melting of the metabasalts in the eclogite facies, followed by interaction with the convecting mantle and variable degrees of crustal assimilation. Together with the similar zircon age populations between the xenoliths and the host rocks, these lines of evidence strongly suggest their genetic link via thickening, foundering, and partial melting of the Archean North China craton mafic lower crust, followed by adakitic melt-mantle interaction. The crustal thickening resulted from Triassic collision between the Yangtze craton and the North China craton, which produced the Dabie-Sulu UHPM belt in the subducting Yangtze plate and eclogitization of the basaltic crustal root of the overriding North China craton plate. Such processes may have played an important role in generating the high-Mg character of the continental crust.

Single zircon U-Pb dating indicates that these volcanics formed at 125.8±3.0 Ma. Their Sr and Nd isotopic compositions (143Nd/144Nd = 0.51180-0.51182, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7062-0.7063) fall in the range of the nearby late-Mesozoic basaltic rocks. These volcanics share geochemical affinities to the adakites formed in the modern arcs, e.g., high Na2O (>4.06%), Al2O3 (>15.4%) and Sr (645-1389 ppm) contents and Sr/Y ratios (55∼103), and thus being termed as adakitic rocks. However, the Baiqi adakitic rocks were not temporospatially associated with active subduction. Furthermore, their low Cr (2.19-47.4 ppm, with average of 25) and Ni (1.57-20.7 ppm, with average of 12) contents and Mg# (22-47, with average of 32) argue against interaction with the lithospheric mantle. Combined with the geological setting, we suggest that the Baiqi adakitic rocks resulted from partial melting of a thickened lower continental crust associated two episodes of basaltic underplating events. We propose that enormous conductive heating from 80-140 Ma basaltic underplating resulted in partial melting of pre-existing mafic lower crust formed by ∼150-160 Ma basaltic underplating. This study provides a case for partial melting of the thickened lower continental crust in association with basaltic underplating events.", "authors": ["Xuan‐Ce Wang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Xiaoming

Concentrations of HNO3 have a significant effect on the arsenic signal. This type of interference cannot be corrected by internal standards (Rh and In) because the signal suppression due to HNO3 is apparently dependent on the first ionization potential of elements. Addition of 4% (v/v) ethanol to 1–10% (v/v) HNO3 was found to be an excellent method for reducing this type of matrix effect from 30–40% to less than 5% for high first ionization potential elements 75As (9.81 eV), 82Se (9.75 eV), and 126Te (9.01 eV). Direct determination of arsenic in geological samples by ICP-MS is often complicated by the presence of Nd2+, Sm2+and Eu2+ interferences, in addition to the well known interference of ArCl+, and the high first ionization potential of As (9.81 eV) also results in relatively low analytical sensitivity in ICP-MS. It is shown that both problems can be overcome by a combination of a 4% ethanol matrix modifier with nebulizer gas flow rate adjustment. For example, the interference from doubly charged ions of a rare earth element (Ce2+) is reduced by a factor of 30 with the addition of 4% ethanol at a nebulizer gas flow rate of 1.00 l min−1 and rf power of 1350 W, while the signal intensity of As is similar in both solutions. A nebulizer gas flow rate of 0.94 l min−1, an rf power of 1350 W and 4% ethanol modifier were chosen in practical sample analysis. Under these conditions, the interference of doubly charged ions of the rare earth element (Ce2+) was reduced by a factor of 6.5 and the signal intensity of As was improved by a factor of 3 relative to that in 3% (v/v) HNO3 solution at the corresponding optimum nebulizer gas flow rate of 0.98 l min−1 and rf power of 1350 W. The arsenic equivalent concentration caused by ArCl+ interference was reduced by a factor of 10 under our given experimental conditions in the presence of 4% (v/v) ethanol.

This result is inconsistent with the crustal overthickening model postulated by England and Thompson (1984), wherein rocks which reach different metamorphic grades must have reached peak temperatures at different times. Instead, the presence of additional sources of heat, such as magmatic intrusions and metamorphic fluids, may have contributed to the contemporaneous development of low and high grades. The Wepawaug Schist, a metapelitic schist in south-central Connecticut exhibiting a Barrovian sequence, provides another terrane in which to test the model of advective heat transport. Here, we present the first Sm/Nd garnet ages from the Wepawaug Schist. HF-partial dissolution techniques were employed to cleanse the garnets of problematic mineral inclusions to ensure accuracy and improve the precision of garnet ages. Two-point whole rock-garnet isochrons yield an age of 379.2 ± 6.7Ma (2σ) for peak metamorphism in a sample from the garnet isograd, whereas garnet rim growth was dated at 379.9 ± 6.8Ma (2σ) in a kyanite zone sample. These ages are indicative of Acadian-age metamorphism. The two garnet ages are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that peak garnet growth (and likely peak metamorphic temperatures) was attained penecontemporaneously across all metamorphic grades in the Wepawaug. A coincidence of peak metamorphic ages requires an additional source of heat to steepen the geotherm such as could be provided by local igneous intrusions and enhanced by fluid flow.", "authors": ["Penelope J.

Mineral assemblage distributions in a large blueschist outcrop, adjacent to the basal contact of a 150‐meter thick marble horizon, were mapped at centimeter‐scale resolution onto digital photographs using a belt‐worn computer and graphics editing software. Digital mapping reveals that while most HP‐LT rocks in the outcrop were pervasively retrograded to greenschist facies, the marble‐blueschist contact zone underwent an even more intense retrogression. Preservation of HP‐LT mineral assemblages was mainly restricted to a 10–15 meter zone (or enclave) adjacent to the intensely retrograded lithologic contact. The degree and distribution of the retrograde overprint suggests that pervasively infiltrating fluids were channelized into the marble‐blueschist contact and associated veins and flowed around the preserved HP‐LT enclave. Numerical modeling of Darcian flow, based on the field observations, suggests that near the marble horizon, deflections in fluid flow paths caused by flow channelization along the high‐permeability marble‐blueschist contact zone likely resulted in very large fluid fluxes along the lithologic contact and significantly smaller fluxes (as much as 8 times smaller than the input flux) within the narrow, low‐flux regions where HP‐LT minerals were preserved adjacent to the contact. Our results indicate that lithologic contacts are important conduits for metamorphic fluid flow in subduction zones.

Xenoliths from the kimberlite yield Re depleted Os model ages (T_(RD)) of 2.5～2.8 Ga. This confirms the presence of Archean lithospheric mantle beneath the North China Craton. The Hannuoba xenoliths give a Re-Os isotopic isochron of (1.9±0.18) Ga, which demonstrates that the present-day lithospheric mantle preserved there is Paleoproterozoic in age. The surface of the Hannuoba area is dominated by Archean crustal rocks, suggesting former presence of Archean mantle. However, lack of Archean ages in the Hannuoba peridotite xenoliths show that the Archean mantle had been replaced by the newly formed Paleoproterozoic mantle. This event coincides with the widespread Paleoproterozoic granulite-facies metamorphism resulting from continental collision. This in turn implies that the Paleoproterozoic removal of the lithospheric mantle were associated with lithospheric delamination. The Qixia xenoliths have Os isotopic compositions similar to the present-day convecting mantle and show no correlations between Os isotopic and Re/Os ratios, which suggest that they are very young in age. Together with other lines of geological and geochemical evidence, these results point to Mesozoic removal of the lithospheric mantle in the eastern North China Craton, which is speculated to be associated with delamination of the lower crust and lithospheric mantle induced by the Triassic collision between the North China and Yangtze cratons. The present study documents that timing and location of removal of the lithospheric mantle vary from the western to the eastern parts of the North China craton. The 2.5～2.8 Ga and 1.9 Ga lithospheric mantle forming events agree with the two most important crustal growth episodes in the North China craton.

Samples were collected at meter or submeter intervals along outcrop-length traverses and combined to obtain average chemical compositions of whole outcrops. Mass-balance analysis used Zr as an immobile reference frame and as a monitor of sedimentary sorting processes. SiO2-Zr systematics produced by sedimentary processes differ greatly from those caused by metasomatic mass transfer of silica, allowing evaluation of vein-formation mechanisms. Relatively undeformed metasedimentary outcrops of low metamorphic grade (mostly prehnite-pumpellyite facies) are nearly unveined and characterized by sedimentary compositional trends. More deformed outcrops of higher metamorphic grade (mostly greenschist facies) contain 10–30 vol% quartz veins. These outcrops underwent mass addition of externally derived silica into quartz veins, accompanied by addition of Na and removal of K and W. Average silica additions suggest a time-integrated fluid flux of ∼104–105 \\(m^{3}_{(fluid)}\\) / \\(m^{2}_{(rock)}\\) for fluids ascending through the prism. Dehydration of spilitized oceanic crust subducting beneath the prism is the most probable source for this large fluid flux and could also have caused the Na-K metasomatism. The W removed from deep levels of the prism may have been deposited in focused, retrograde Au-W-quartz veins at shallow levels by ascending fluids. Transfer of SiO2 from subducting slabs into accretionary prisms is a plausible mechanism for long-term bulk silica enrichment of the continents beyond that possible by magmatic differentiation.

Multiple garnet growth generations were identified on the basis of the geochronology and detailed textural and chemical data: an early stage, at 472.9 ± 2.9 Ma, during D 2 deformation under garnet zone conditions (c. 500–550 °C), and a later stage, at 464.8 ± 2.7 Ma, during or slightly after D 3 deformation mostly under sillimanite zone conditions (peak temperature of c. 660 °C), but possibly including some growth during kyanite zone conditions. When combined with recently published garnet ages from the kyanite and garnet zones the data suggest that peak metamorphic temperatures in at least these three of Barrow's zones were achieved roughly contemporaneously. The difference between garnet zone and sillimanite zone peak temperature attainment is 2.8 ± 3.7 Ma.

A total of 94% of the samples lack graphite, contain both ilmenite–hematite solid solutions (RHOMOX) and magnetite, and had metamorphic fO2 about 2 log10 units above the quartz–fayalite–magnetite (QFM) buffer. The regional variation in metamorphic fO2 for these rocks was minimal, about ±0·3 log10 units, reflecting either a protolith that was homogeneous with respect to redox state, or an initially variable protolith whose redox state was homogenized by metamorphic fluid–rock interaction. RHOMOX inclusions in garnet porphyroblasts that become richer in ilmenite from the interior to the edge of the host porphyroblast suggest that at least some syn-metamorphic reduction of rock occurred. Significant variations in bulk-rock oxidation ratio (OR) that are probably inherited from sedimentary protoliths are found from one layer to the next; OR ranges mostly between ∼20 and ∼50 [OR = molecular 2Fe2O3 × 100/(2Fe2O3 + FeO)]. These OR variations are uncorrelated with fO2 and do not indicate that large, order-of-magnitude gradients in fO2 and redox state existed or were preserved between layers during metamorphism. The other 6% of the samples contain ilmenite, lack magnetite, and had low fO2 0–1 order of magnitude below QFM in the stability field of graphite. They are characterized by combinations of the following: large fluid HF/H2O; metasomatic, tourmaline-bearing veins; absence or rarity of primary organic matter; and crosscutting late metamorphic shear zones rich in carbonaceous material. Such observations suggest that locally low fO2 conditions may have been related to the influx of reducing fluids from elsewhere in the area.", "authors": ["Jay J. Ague", "Ethan F. Baxter", "James O.

Particularly in metamorphic rocks, zircon U-Pb isotope systems are often complicated by significant departures from concordia. Understanding the processes that generate discordance in natural settings, and the extent to which they operate, are necessary to correctly interpret isotope data and to assess the validity of concordia intercept ages. Metamorphic fluids have been acknowledged as one potential agent that could enhance indiscriminate removal of Pb and U from zircon resulting in isotopic discordance [1]. Empirical studies confirm that, in the presence of hydrothermal fluids, mobility of Pb and U from zircon is a function of fluid composition, temperature and pressure, including various processes acting preferentially on α-radiation damaged zircon [2]. Chronological interpretations often appeal to transient metamorphic fluids as a means by which zircon might undergo disturbance, resulting in marked radiogenic Pb loss and discordance. However, it can be difficult to confidently demonstrate the relationship of fluid infiltration with zircon isotopic modification and fluid compositions considered responsible for zircon modification are often uncertain. This raises an important issue. What is the magnitude of zircon isotopic disturbance when exposed to aqueous infiltrating fluids under elevated metamorphic conditions in real geological environments? In this contribution we document an example of an Archaean orthogneiss which experienced fluid infiltration during the Early Paleozoic. We show that this aqueous fluid, under static amphibolite facies conditions, had a small but measurable effect on pre-existing zircon hosted within the orthogneiss. Geological Setting: The location of this study, the Napier Complex, east Antarctica, experienced Archaean ultra-high T metamorphism, dehydrating the terrane. Early Paleozoic felsic pegmatites and quartz veins were then emplaced, around which formed spectacular upper amphibolite-facies alteration selvedges as much as 2m wide. Selvedges were produced during rehydration of the host protolith as a result of fluid influx during pegmatite emplacement. No pervasive deformation of the protolith accompanied pegmatite emplacement or fluid infiltration. Within pyroxene-bearing felsic orthogneiss, the dominant lithology of the terrane, selvedges are characterized by replacement of primary pyroxene by hydrous assemblages. Comparison of zircon from unaltered protolith and hydrated protolith adjacent to pegmatites and permit assessment of the isotopic disturbance experienced by zircon during fluid infiltration. P-T conditions during fluid influx were ~8 kbar at ~675°C. The infiltrating fluid was aqueous with XH2O of ~1, and halogen contents, based on biotite-fluid equilibria, were low. Results: Ion probe (CAMECA IMS 1270 at UCLA) zircon U-Pb data from the altered protolith is shown below, together with U-Pb data for monazites from the pegmatite on a conventional concordia diagram. A regression performed using zircon data alone yields an upper intercept of 2458 ±13 Ma (2σ), which corresponds to an episode of zircon growth widely reported in isotopic studies of the Napier Complex.", "authors": ["Chris Carson", "Jay J.

P and S wave velocities and densities of 12 Hannuoba lower crustal xenoliths and one associated spinel Iherzolite xenolith as well as nine granulites and granulite‐facies metasedimentary rocks from the Archean Huai 'an terrain were measured in laboratory at pressures up to 600 MPa and temperatures up to 600°C. Calculations of P and S wave velocities were also made for the same suite of samples based on modal mineralogy and single‐crystal velocities whose variations with composition are considered by using microprobe analyses and velocities of end members. The measured and calculated V p at room temperature and 600 MPa, where the microcrack effect is considered to be almost eliminated, agree within 4% for rocks from the Manjinggou‐Wayaokou section and the adjacent Wutai‐Jining upper crustal to upper lower crustal section. In contrast, the xenoliths show systematically lower measured V p by up to 15% relative to calculated velocities, even if decompression‐induced products of kelyphite and glass are taken into account. The lower measured velocities for xenoliths are attributed to grain boundary alteration and residual porosity. This implies that although granulite xenoliths provide direct information about lower crustal constitution and chemical composition, they are not faithful samples for studying in situ seismic properties of the lower crust in terms of measured velocities due to alterations during their entrainment to the surface, which changes their physical properties significantly. In this respect, granulites from high‐grade terrains are better samples because they are not subjected to significant changes during their slow transport to the surface and because physical properties depend primarily on mineralogy in addition to pressure and temperature. On the other hand, calculated velocities for granulite xenoliths are consistent with velocities for granulites from terrains, suggesting that they can be also used to infer lower crust composition by correlating with results from seismic refraction studies.", "authors": ["Shan Gao", "H.

The observed loss of CO2 from metamorphic belts remains problematic, however, because the cooling that accompanies fluid ascent favors reactions that add CO2 to metacarbonate rock by removing CO2 from fluids. A new two-dimensional model of coupled mass transfer, chemical reaction, and heat transport was developed to assess how rock devolatilization proceeds along the upward escape paths of crustal fluids during prograde metamorphism. The model is based on upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies growth of amphibole in metacarbonate layers and garnet and biotite in intercalated metapelite layers of the Wepawaug Schist, Connecticut (Acadian orogeny). The modeling indicates that during heating, CO2 concentrations were larger in metacarbonate layers than in adjacent metapelite layers because amphibole growth in metacarbonates produced CO2, whereas garnet and biotite growth in metapelites produced H2O. The resulting cross-layer concentration gradients drove H2O into the metacarbonate layers and CO2 out by diffusion and the transverse component of mechanical dispersion. Such cross-layer mass transfer can continually force rock decarbonation while fluids ascend, dominating the effects of cooling, unless fluid fluxes are large and prograde heating rates are small. Consequently, prograde metamorphism of carbonate-bearing sedimentary sequences containing significant amounts of pelitic rock will release CO2 to regionally migrating fluids in a wide range of orogenic settings, regardless of whether flow is in a direction of increasing or decreasing temperature. Regional CO2 release can be driven by outcrop-scale processes of volatile exchange between contrasting lithologies.

Carbon and oxygen isotopic data were collected from carbonated spilites and carbonate‐bearing veins in the Highland Boundary Fault, from Dalradian metacarbonate layers and pervasively carbonated schists, and from three generations of carbonate‐bearing veins, and a quartz porphyry dyke within the Dalradian. Isotopic evidence for syn‐metamorphic fluid infiltration in the Dalradian is preserved in quartz–calcite veins in the upper chlorite zone and in staurolite zone metacarbonates. δ 18 O values for coexisting quartz (δ 18 O quartz = 13.6‰) and calcite (δ 18 O calcite = 11.6‰) in a vein from the upper chlorite zone are consistent with precipitation of both minerals from a single fluid at c. 375°C. Oxygen isotopic data from staurolite zone metacarbonate layers (δ 18 O calcite = 10.4 to 12.9‰) suggest major isotopic exchange with an external fluid equilibrated with a quartzo‐feldspathic reservoir, such as the Dalradian metasediments, at metamorphic temperatures. Low, negative carbon isotope data from these metacarbonate layers (δ 13 C calcite = −12.4 to −17.7‰) may indicate a component of oxidized organic material in the infiltrating fluid. Post‐metamorphic fluids derived from or equilibrated with a high‐temperature silicate reservoir such as felsic igneous rocks were responsible for precipitation of post‐metamorphic vein carbonate, carbonation of pelitic schists, and alteration of metamorphic feldspar porphyroblasts from Barrow’s famous spotted chloritoid schists in an area geographically associated with several carbonated quartz porphyry dykes. Some veins in the biotite and garnet zones have been conduits for multiple generations of fluid flow. Quartz from this generation of veins preserves a metamorphic isotopic signature (δ 18 O quartz = 11.2 to 13.2‰) whereas dolomite and calcite are considered to be post‐metamorphic based on textural evidence and isotopic data indicating extreme oxygen isotopic disequilibrium between vein quartz and carbonate minerals (δ 18 O dolomite = 23.7 to 24.2‰, δ 18 O calcite = 25.3‰, δ 18 O quartz = 11.2 to 13.2‰). Variably depleted carbon isotopes from carbonate minerals in these veins (δ 13 C dolomite = −8.1 to −13.4‰, δ 13 C calcite = −12.2‰) may reflect input of oxidized organic material in the mineralizing fluid. Isotopic data from carbonate veins and variably carbonated spilites from the Highland Boundary Fault are consistent with hydrothermal alteration of basalts by seawater, which had its carbon isotope systematics modified by addition of magmatic CO 2 and/or oxidation of organic carbon.

Two broad models in which reaction progress is controlled by gradients in H2O–CO2 fluid composition between different rock types are presented. In the first, diffusional exchange of volatiles across lithologic contacts is significant. CO2 generated during prograde temperature (T) rise is transported away from metacarbonate layers to surrounding (1) metapelitic layers which generate H2O by dehydration and/or (2) flow conduits (e.g. permeable layers or fractures) for externally derived, elevated XH2O/XCO2 fluids. H2O is transported from the surroundings into the metacarbonate layers and drives further mineral reaction. In the second model, reaction in metacarbonate layers is driven mostly by layer-parallel flow of external fluids with elevated XH2O/XCO2 derived from, for example, dehydrating schists or outgassing magmas. For both models, the XCO2 of the fluid within metacarbonate layers is generally predicted to increase with increasing grade from the Ankerite–Oligoclase to the Amphibole zones, and then decrease in the Diopside zone—key relationships that are commonly observed in the field. The slow reaction progress in metacarbonates driven by progressive dehydration of surrounding metapelite from greenschist to amphibolite facies probably requires time scales of fluid–rock interaction comparable to the duration of the Acadian orogeny (~106−107 my). Intense episodes of fluid flow through conduits such as fractures may produce veins and alteration selvages over fluid–rock interaction times as short as 103–104 years. Model results emphasize that the accuracy of field-based fluid flux estimates depends critically on correct identification of mass transport processes. The modeling suggests that reactive transport of volatiles between metacarbonate layers and their lithologically heterogeneous surroundings can account for basic T–fluid composition–reaction progress relationships observed in much of the Acadian orogen of New England. The results provide an alternative to up-T flow scenarios that account for these relationships by large, pervasive, horizontal fluid fluxes up regional T gradients.", "authors": ["Jay J.

Based on a new interpretation of existing kinetic data for the dehydration of model serpentinite, we advance the hypothesis that P f buildup to tensile failure may be possible within decades of the onset of dehydration in low permeability metamorphic rocks of the middle crust. This model contrasts with both: 1) typical earthquake nucleation models which involve preexisting fluids that play a passive role, responding to tectonic stresses rather than generating them and 2) conventional treatments of P f generation based on equilibrium thermodynamics and constant rates of dehydration, which require 10³–10 6 years to produce significant P f increases.

The importance of regional temperature and pressure gradients in producing the sequence is well established, but the petrogenetic significance of mass transport of nonvolatile elements by metamorphic processes remains controversial. This paper focuses on the impact of fluid flow through fractures (now quartz veins) on the geochemical and petrologic evolution of metamorphosed clastic rocks in the northeastern part of Barrow's garnet zone, Scotland. The veins constitute ∼13 vol % of the total rock mass and are generally surrounded by zones rich in plagioclase. A traverse along a typical metasedimentary bed cut by a vein reveals that, as one approaches the vein, (1) plagioclase porphyroblast size and An content increase, (2) the modal plagioclase/muscovite ratio increases, (3) bulk rock Na/K, Ca/K, Sr/Rb, (Na + Ca + K)/Al, Mg/FeT, and (Mg + FeT)/Al increase, and (4) bulk rock Si/Ti decreases. The plagioclase-rich zones are interpreted to be alteration selvages that developed as a result of fluid infiltration through fractures; the alteration reaction destroyed muscovite and produced plagioclase. Furthermore, in some rocks the assemblage garnet + biotite + chlorite was stable in the most intensely altered areas directly adjacent to vein margins, whereas chloritoid + biotite + chlorite was stable in less-altered and unaltered areas. Geochemical relations suggest that the fluid flow was in a direction of increasing temperature and that the vein quartz was mostly derived from local wall rocks. It appears that open-system transport of nonvolatile elements can exert important, previously unrecognized controls on rock chemistry and the growth of common regional metamorphic mineral assemblages.

Application of the barometer has remained controversial because the controls on the aluminum content of hornblende imposed by temperature (T), magma composition, and fluid composition remain incompletely understood. In this paper, the P-T conditions of equilibration for 19 rocks from the Mesozoic batholiths of California are estimated by simultaneous evaluation of (1) the P-sensitive reaction tremolite + phlogopite + 2 anorthite + 2 albite = 2 pargasite + 6 quartz + K-feldspar and (2) previously published amphibole-plagioclase thermometer equilibria. P estimates for the batholiths range from 1.2 to 7.4 kbar and are consistent with independent geologic evidence. The highest P samples (5.1–7.4 kbar) are located near the San Andreas fault. Furthermore, it appears that regional P gradients determined by previous AH barometry studies are valid, but that the absolute values of the P estimates will need to be revised somewhat (±1.5 kbar). I suggest that the method of this study provides a viable, thermodynamics-based alternative to conventional AH barometry that requires no a priori assumptions about T or bulk composition.

The method is used to correct previously published paleomagnetic data from the 93–96 Ma Mount Stuart batholith of the Cascades Mountains, Washington State, for the effects of postemplacement tilting. AH barometry was done on 46 samples from the batholith using the compositions of hornblende rims coexisting with the full mineral assemblage required for pressure estimation. High-contrast back-scattered electron imaging was used to ensure that the analyzed hornblendes were not significantly affected by subsolidus alteration.The success of the AH barometry is indicated by two observations. First, increases in the Al content of the hornblendes are governed almost entirely by a pressure-sensitive tschermak-type substitution. Second, amphibole-plagioclase thermometry indicates that assemblage equilibration occurred at or very near magmatic conditions (≈650°C) and that temperature has a negligible effect on our pressure estimates. AH barometry results indicate that the depth of crystallization across the batholith decreases systematically from ≈0.3 GPa in the northwest to ≈0.15 GPa in the southeast, consistent with independent barometry for the contact aureole of the batholith and regional structural and stratigraphic relations. Using a best-fit planar-tilt model and bootstrap analysis of uncertainties, we estimate that the paleohorizontal plane has a strike of 43° ± 30.4° and dip of 7° ± 2.0° southeast (±95% confidence).Our estimated paleohorizontal allows us to restore the paleomagnetic data of Beck et al. (1981) and to estimate the original paleolatitude of the Mount Stuart batholith. Beck et al. found that the southern part of the batholith yielded a number of sites with a well-defined high-coercivity remanence. The carrier of this remanence was not resolved, but the following four lines of evidence strongly suggest that the published directions were acquired shortly after emplacement of the batholith. (1) The \"stable\" sites all came from the shallowest and most rapidly cooled portions of the batholith as indicated by our AH results and concordant K/Ar ages for hornblende/biotite pairs. (2) The high coercivity component was always normal in polarity, which is consistent with emplacement of the Mount Stuart batholith at the end of the Cretaceous long normal. (3) Sites from the batholith and the contact aureole gave similar directions. (4) The directions show no indication of tilt-related smearing. After restoration, the paleomagnetic data indicate 42° ± 11° clockwise rotation and 3100 ± 600 km of northward offset (±95% confidence). This result verifies Beck et al.'s original interpretation that the Mount Stuart batholith originated at the paleolatitude of northern Mexico. This content is PDF only.

Analysis of metasomatic effects using standard statistical methods designed for unconstrained, univariant data often fails to provide useful results for several important reasons:1. The concentration of any constituent in a composition is constrained to be between 0 and 100 wt percent.2. The sum of the concentrations of all constituents must be 100 wt percent (the closure constraint). Compositions are multivariate and provide information only about the relative proportions of constituents.3. The maximum possible mass or volume loss is -100 percent (-100% corresponds to complete mass or volume loss).4. Rock bulk density must be greater than 0 g cm (super -3) .5. The underlying probability distributions for mass and volume changes are commonly non-normal.To address these issues, we use statistical procedures recently developed to treat the special properties of compositional data, including closure, and the bootstrap method to compute accurate confidence intervals for assessing how far in error best estimates of mass and volume change are likely to be. The bootstrap deals effectively with non-normality and constraints (1), (3), and (4).We apply our approach to gain a better understanding of synmetamorphic (Acadian orogeny) hydrothermal alteration of upper greenschist facies and amphibolite facies marble beds of the Wepawaug Schist, Connecticut. The marbles lost significant amounts of volatiles (dominantly CO 2 and H 2 O), Si, Ti, K, Rb, Sr, and Ba. Best estimates of total mass and volume change are -27 and -32 percent, respectively. The bulk of the lost mass was volatiles ( approximately 140 g kg (super -1) ), SiO 2 ( approximately 60 g kg (super -1) ), and K 2 O ( approximately 15 g kg (super -1) ) (numbers are g lost per kg of parent rock). Volatile loss was probably regional in scope. Loss of Si, Ti, K, Rb, Sr, and Ba occurred over minimum length scales on the order of typical hand sample dimensions; maximum length scales remain to be determined.The FORTRAN 77 computer code that performs the calculations described herein is available from the senior author.", "authors": ["Jay J.

Thermal magnetic analysis indicates that magnetite and maghemite of hard magnetism are the major carries of remanent magnetism in the metaclastic sedimentary rocks and TTG gneisses. In contrast, the amphibolite and gabbro contain significant amounts of magetite of soft magnetism and pyrrhotite. Magnetism of metaclastic sedimentary rocks and TTG gneisses is highly inhomogeneous, comparison with magnetic characteristics of rocks from other amphibolite to granulite facies terrains indicates that the Kongling metaclastic sedimentary rocks were subjected to granulite facies metamorphism and formed in the lower crust depth. The amphibolite underwent lower grade metamorphism of probably high-amphibolite facies and were produced apparently in the middle crust.

The veins preserve substantial open space today in outcrop, and contain mineral assemblages including subhedral to euhedral crystals of quartz, kyanite and almandine‐rich garnet. Textural evidence indicates unequivocally that the vein minerals grew into macroscopic (mm‐ to cm‐scale) open space between the vein walls. The veins are interpreted to have been large‐aperture fractures along which significant advective fluid infiltration and chemical reaction occurred. The porosity of the rock mass due to open space between fracture walls today is c . 0.3%, but it could have been as large as several percent when the flow system was active. Quantitative thermobarometry results from vein mineral assemblages indicate that the fractures formed at pressures and corresponding crustal depths of c. 0.8 GPa and c. 30km, and temperatures of 550–600° C. The depth of fracture formation corresponds to published estimates of the maximum burial depth of the Merrimack synclinorium during the Acadian orogeny.

Samples were collected from this contact zone in order to quantify the time-temperature history of the schist using the geospeedometry method of Lasaga (1983). Pseudomorphic textures and garnet-aluminosilicate-plagioclase (GASP) geobarometry within some samples show an increase in pressure during crystal growth, consistent with the interpretation of Evans and Berti (1986), that regional metamorphism followed intrusion of the MSB. Geospeedometry exploits the kinetics of diffusion associated with the thermo-barometric exchange reactions in order to determine the retrograde cooling history of a metamorphic rock. This technique was applied using Fe-Mg diffusion between garnet and biotite as defined by that geothermometer. Modeling results indicate that the region was exhumed and cooled from about 22 km and 610 C to about 8 km and 525 C, in a period of about 2.5 Myr. The average exhumation rate is 5.6 km/Myr.

Changes in mass m result from open-system behavior where solid mass is removed or added to the rock, usually by processes of solution transfer.

Statistical analysis of the data shows that Barrovian zone metamorphism of pelitic schist generally causes increases in the whole-rock concentrations of the low-solubility elements Ti and All The observed increases in Ti and Al contents as functions of metamorphic grade are almost certainly due to residual enrichment caused by the removal of other more soluble species. Application of mass-balance principles to the petite compositional trends indicates that the average pelite may lose as much as 30% of its mass and volume during progressive metamorphism from subgreenschist to amphibolite facies conditions. The bulk of the lost mass is silica, not volatiles. In addition, other elements, particularly Ca, Na, and K, appear to be highly mobile in deep-crustal metamorphism. Contrary to conventional interpretations, it is concluded that the regional metamorphism of pelites is not an isochemical process. This content is PDF only. Please click on the PDF icon to access.

We utilize a new program developed to model simultaneously advective solute transport in variably saturated porous media and chemical fluid-rock interactions incorporating mineral dissolution kinetics. Field and laboratory analytic and mineralogic data from supergene enrichment systems at Butte, Montana, and Ok Tedi, located in western Papua New Guinea, are used to provide geochemical, lithologic, and hydrologic initial and boundary conditions required for geologically relevant modeling.We have simulated the weathering and supergene enrichment of porphyry copper potassium silicate proto-ore or containing disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite in a one-dimensional, vertically oriented flow region under steady flow conditions for a total model time of about 12,000 yr. During this time primary chalcopyrite dissolves completely from the leached and blanket zones, pyrite is destroyed in the leached zone, and magnetite dissolves from the entire flow region. We therefore investigate both supergene enrichment processes and the response of the system to complete dissolution of a protore reactant.Computed mineral assemblages are generally in excellent agreement with those observed in natural systems. Although copper is remobilized in the simulation by leaching above the model ground-water table and reprecipitation below it, the resulting differentiated weathering profile is chemically closed with respect to copper. This is because nearly all of the transported copper is fixed below the ground-water table by secondary sulfide precipitation. Therefore, an important conclusion to be drawn from the modeling is that in natural oxidative weathering, vertical copper fluxes out of supergene systems are probably negligible even over extremely long periods of geologic time. These theoretical results confirm earlier calculations of amounts of erosion and erosion rates, and reconstructions of paleotopography assuming copper mass balance in regions of vertical fluid flow (Brimhall et al., 1985; Alpers and Brimhall, 1988, 1989). Sulfur, in contrast, is mobile during the simulation and significant quantities of sulfate leave the flow region with time. Modeling results indicate that the dominant source of sulfur for secondary copper sulfide mineral formation in the enrichment blanket is the preexisting protore sulfides, not electrochemical reduction of the sulfate transported out of the leached zone. The numerical simulation demonstrates that oxygen fugacity is the primary control governing the nature and extent of low-temperature reequilibration of the fossil magmatic-hydrothermal system in the near-surface weathering environment.", "authors": ["Jay J.

Thermodynamic calculations indicate that at magmatic conditions, Fe-Mg exchange between biotite and amphibole is probably not a strong function of crystallization temperature. However, theoretical predictions and natural mafic phase compositions show that the Fe-Mg distribution is dependent upon amphibole composition. Specifically, decreases in amphibole total Al and A-site occupancy lead to increases in the Mg/(Mg+FeT) of amphibole relative to the Mg/(Mg+FeT) of coexisting biotite. In magmas containing the appropriate igneous buffering assemblage, amphibole Al content is positively correlated with crystallization pressure (cf. Hammarstrom and Zen, 1986). In these magmas, the distribution of Fe and Mg between coexisting amphibole and biotite is primarily a function of consolidation pressure, owing to the dependence of Mg/(Mg+FeT) on Al content in amphibole. Variations in natural amphibole chemistry as a function of crystallization pressure indicate that the dominant pressure-sensitive coupled substitution in amphibole in the batholiths of California is probably of the form: (A-site)+(Mg+Fe2+)+2Si⇔(Na+K)(A-site)+2AlIV+(Al+Fe3+)VI", "authors": ["Jay J.

In so doing, we gain new insights into the nature of magmatic source rocks and mechanisms of magma generation in volcano-plutonic arcs of active continental margins. Little-studied metaluminous to strongly peraluminous granites containing Fe-rich biotite with log(XMg/XFe) < -0.21 (I-SCR type; strongly contaminated and reduced I-type) typically occur in north-northwest-striking belts within pre-batholithic wall-rock terranes containing graphitic pelites in the western Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Ranges batholiths. The other pluton types (I-WC, I-MC, and I-SC; weakly, moderately, and strongly contaminated, but not reduced, I-types) range in composition from metaluminous to weakly peraluminous and form a general west-to-east progression across the batholiths defined by increasing F/OH in biotite. This correlates with the well-known petrologic sequence from quartz diorites and granodiorites on the west to quartz monzonites and granites to the east. I-WC types also occur in the central-eastern Sierra Nevada batholith, however, primarily in the vicinity of the Independence dike swarm.F/OH and Mn in biotite and amphibole increase on a regional scale from western I-WC types to eastern I-MC and I-SC types, parallel to eastward increases in incompatible elements and decreases in compatible elements in the plutons. In contrast, the belts of western I-SCR granites and eastern I-WC quartz diorites and granodiorites disrupt the regional west-to-east systematics in both mineral and whole-rock geochemistry. Spatial variations in the Al content of amphibole are regional in scale and reflect pressures of pluton crystallization. We conclude that significant, previously unrecognized complexity exists in regional geochemical systematics in the California batholiths. This content is PDF only.

Low fHF/ fH2Oof formation of western I-WC types is consistent with their derivation from low-fluorine source rocks in subducted oceanic slabs or the upper mantle. In contrast,higher fHF/fH2Oof crystallization of I-MC and I-SC types to the east implies the involvement of (1) progressively greater amounts of continental crustal source material such as biotite-bearing metamorphic rocks, their unweathered sedimentary derivatives retaining F-rich mafic minerals, or their fusion products and/or (2) source materials which become more F-rich toward the continental interior. The regional distribution of I-MC and I-SC types suggests that the Precambrian craton of western North America, or derivative sediments, may extend farther north in California and be morphologically more complex than previously thought. From seemingly out-of- place occurrences of I-WC plutons on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada batholith, we infer the existence of regions where Precambrian basement was thin or absent in Mesozoic time, which prevented extensive cratonal contamination of subducted slab or upper mantle-derived magmas.New methods for estimating T-fO2 relations in the magmas demonstrate that I-SCR granites crystallize at oxygen fugacities as much as five orders of magnitude lower than those of I-WC, I-MC, and I-SC types under conditions at or below the maximum stability limit of graphite in equilibrium with a C-O-H-S gas phase. The local-scale formation of I-SCR granites in plutonic belts within specific wall-rock terranes containing highly reducing sediments or metasediments may occur by contamination of I-types with graphitic pelite or, in some cases, by the direct fusion of this reducing pelitic wall rock. The spatial distribution of I-SCR granite provinces therefore is controlled simply by wall-rock lithology.Amphibole geobarometry demonstrates a general west-to-east decrease in crystallization pressure across the Sierra Nevada batholith. In contrast, the Peninsular Ranges batholith displays a west-to-east crystallization pressure increase. The bulk of the California batholiths crystallized at pressures less than 4-5 kb and depths less than about 15-19 km. In the southern Sierra Nevada batholith, the San Gabriels, and the eastern Peninsular Ranges, however, plutons crystallized at pressures exceeding 6 kb at deep crustal levels (>23 km). Reconstruction of the pre-erosion top of the batholith shows that in an east-west cross section, the central Sierra Nevada batholith was a horizontal tabular body with an aspect ratio of at least five to one.

Compositional data on plutonic biotites, whole-rock chemistry, and mineral assemblages in rocks collected as part of sampling traverses across die batholiths of central and southern California are assessed for this purpose. We conclude that two distinct types of granites occur in California. One type, largely overlooked in the past and which we term I-SCR (strongly contaminated and reduced I type), is confined to narrow northwest-striking belts in the western Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Ranges batholiths in prebatholithic continental margin terrenes containing reduced pelitic roof pendants. We interpret the I-SCR magmas to have arisen from local-scale contamination of I-type magmas that intruded reducing pelitic material in sedimentary roof pendant terrenes. We conclude that cordierite-bearing S types are absent from the California batholiths, although sedimentary materials were required to produce the I-SCR plutons. The second type of granite, which we refer to as I-SC (strongly contaminated but not reduced I type), occurs on the eastern side of the California batholiths as part of a well-known regional west-to-east progression from quartz diorites to granites. These granites are the eastern variant of a sequence that is, from west to east, I-WC (weakly contaminated), I-MC (moderately contaminated), and I-SC This eastward progression is not controlled by pendant occurrence and probably reflects increasing contamination on a regional scale of mantle I-type magmas with F-rich igneous and metamorphic rocks, or their sedimentary derivatives, of the Precambrian continental craton. We demonstrate that the nature of prebatholithic terranes can strongly influence the composition and regional distribution of granitic rocks developed in an active continental margin.

Four deformations (DI-D~) and two metamorphic episodes (MI and Mz) have affected the rocks of the Miillerneset area. MI was a prograde event which was initiated prior to the onset of the D1 and continued through this deformation. Pre-DI metamorphism reached biotite grade whereas garnet grade was attained syn-DI. MZ was a lower-middle greenschist facies metamorphism associated with Dz. The results of quantitative geothermometry in the pelitic rocks show that peak MI metamorphic temperatures decrease southwards across the field area from about 540°C to 510°C.

Type IB biotite is found to the east of this belt, and Type IC biotite is confined to the eastern side of the Sierra. Type II biotite is present in the eastern and south-western portions of the Sierra, and sporadically in the metamorphic foothills belt. The two intrusive groups, here characterized by biotite compositions, correspond to two of the source rock and porphyry mineralization models of Burnham (1981). Type I rocks (Cu deposits) are derived from mafic amphiobolites whereas Type II (Sn-W deposits) form from relatively reduced muscovite-rich metasediments. The biotite compositions indicate that the majority of the batholith formed from amphibolite sources. Type II intrusives and W deposits occurmore » in areas underlain by Precambrian crust as defined by radiogenic isotope studies.« less", "authors": ["Jay J. Ague", "George H.
