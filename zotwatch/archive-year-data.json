Their formation requires REE enrichment during prolonged magma evolution, achieved by suppressing REE-rich mineral crystallization and promoting REE-enriched brine melt formation. Our experiments on the fractional crystallization of carbonatitic magmas indicate that pressure (emplacement depth) is the primary factor controlling REE enrichment. High-pressure ( &gt;0.3 GPa) promotes early olivine crystallization, depleting silica and suppressing REE-rich apatite formation. Deep emplacement also delays aqueous fluid exsolution, thereby stabilizing brine melts that enhance phosphate dissolution and prevent REE dispersion into apatite. In contrast, low-pressure conditions ( &lt;0.3 GPa) lead to exsolution of REE-poor hydrothermal fluids, dispersing REE into magmatic apatite and preventing the deposition of economically significant REE-carbonates in subsequent hydrothermal stages. Our pressure-dependent model highlights deep emplacement as crucial for passive REE enrichment in residual brine melts, driving large-scale mineralization through precipitation of burbankite and/or bastnäsite.

This study investigates Mo concentrations and isotope compositions ( δ 98/95 Mo, relative to NIST SRM3134) in basalts from DSDP Sites 417A, 417D, and 418A in the Atlantic, which experienced varying extent of seafloor alteration. These samples display significant Mo concentration (28 to 738 ng/g) and Mo isotopic variability ( δ 98/95 Mo = −2.33‰ to +0.99‰), resulting from distinct alteration conditions. Basalts from Site 417A, which generally underwent oxidative alteration at high water–rock ratios, exhibit low Mo concentrations and low δ 98/95 Mo values (−0.43 ± 0.26‰; 1σ). In these samples, the Mo mobilization ratios (R Mo = [Mo] AOC /[Mo] fresh ) show a positive correlation with δ 98/95 Mo and negative correlations with fluid–rock interaction proxies (e.g., K, Rb, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr), which is consistent with preferential leaching of isotopically heavy Mo from primary minerals during basalt dissolution. In contrast, samples from Site 417D generally exhibit Mo enrichment (ΔMo up to 3) and higher δ 98/95 Mo (up to +0.99‰), likely resulting from carbonate precipitation under relatively reducing conditions. Samples from Site 418A mostly show Mo uptake (R Mo up to 4.5) but lower δ 98/95 Mo (−0.80 ± 0.53‰; 1σ), consistent with adsorption onto Fe-oxyhydroxides in sub-oxic environments. These findings indicate the dual role of altered ocean crust as both Mo sink and source on varying localized scales, which needs consideration in discussing global Mo cycling. The heterogeneity of Mo isotopes in altered ocean crust challenges its characterization as a uniform reservoir and support the notion that deep, unaltered ocean crust may dominate slab-derived Mo fluxes in subduction zones.

We also analyzed amphibolites and metacherts of the metamorphic sole, as subducted slab materials. Furthermore, we examined trace element patterns reconstructed based on analyses of whole rocks and relict clinopyroxene phenocrysts from volcanic rocks of both axial and protoarc stages. The compositions of protoarc tholeiites, which represent the first and most voluminous magmas generated in the protoarc stage, are consistent with flux melting of residual depleted mantle, metasomatized by aqueous fluids liberated from the amphibolite‐facies slab. On the other hand, the successively produced calc‐alkaline, low‐Si boninites show distinctly radiogenic Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope ratios, spoon‐shaped rare earth patterns, and low Nb/Ta ratios, which require addition of amphibolite slab fluids formed at higher temperatures as well as small amounts of mafic‐sedimentary hybrid slab melt to the residual highly depleted mantle. Although axial lavas lack enrichment in fluid‐mobile elements except for K, later off‐ridge lavas exhibit clear K, Sr, and Pb enrichments, suggesting decompression melting of fluid‐metasomatized mantle associated with subduction initiation near the dying spreading ridge.

The introduction of magmatic volatiles in VMS systems may serve as an additional source of these elements. However, the processes through which magmatic volatiles and ore metals have been introduced into hydrothermal systems responsible for the formation of ancient VMS deposits, especially in ancient deposits, remain poorly understood. In this study, we thoroughly conducted Hg isotopic analyses of minerals (pyrite and chalcopyrite) and host rocks, combined to in-situ trace element and Fe redox states of chlorite (i.e. Fe 3+ /∑Fe determined by synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structure) from the Early to Middle Devonian, large-tonnage Ashele VMS deposit in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, in order to understand the sources of ore-forming metals and metallogenic processes. Our results show that ore-associated sulfides and igneous rocks display a wide variation of 0.35‰ in Δ 199 Hg (−0.17‰ to 0.18‰), which overlaps with those of seawater (∼0.2‰), primitive mantle (∼0‰) and continental sediments (∼-0.25‰), supporting a ternary mixing of Hg from three distinct sources. Most of the ore-associated sulfides show near-zero Δ 199 Hg values of −0.1 to 0.1‰, suggesting that ore metals were primarily derived from magmatic fluids, rather than from leaching of underlying volcanic host rocks by heated seawater. The THg (total Hg) content in sulfides and chlorite decreases with increasing distance from the mineralization center, reflecting the variable influence of magmatic volatiles released from the underlying magmatic system, while fluid boiling likely leads to significant variations in δ 202 Hg (exceeding 2‰). The elevated Fe 3+ /∑Fe values, distinct Hg and Sn enrichments, and high formation temperatures (above 400 °C) recorded by Hg-rich chlorite suggest that acidic, hot, oxidized, metal-rich volatiles facilitate the transport of Cu and S from the magmatic to the hydrothermal environment, promoting the formation of large VMS deposits. We propose that the Early Devonian extensional setting enabled oxidized magmatism and volatiles, facilitating efficient Cu and S transport, during which the metal-rich magmatic-hydrothermal fluids (Δ 199 Hg ≈ 0) mixed with seawater (Δ 199 Hg > 0) and continental sediments (Δ 199 Hg 199 Hg range.

Olivine compositions and trace element systematics indicate that the primary magmas of high-Ti picrites could be produced through ~5% partial melting from peridotite mantle source at 3.1-5.1 GPa. Olivine-melt V oxybarometry reveals that the primary magmas exhibit relatively high 𝑓𝑂₂ (ΔFMQ +1.2 to +1.5). The high PGE concentrations (16.0-27.5 ng/g) of the picrites imply that the mantle sulfides were readily dissolved during low-degree partial melting, suggesting that they might have originated from relatively oxidized mantle sources. The elevated 𝑓𝑂₂, inherent from the mantle source, might have promoted early crystallization of Fe–Ti oxides, which ultimately drives the formation of giant Fe–Ti–V oxide deposits. The PGE depletion in the high-Ti basaltic magmas suggests that sulfide saturation was reached during magma evolution, implying the potential for sulfide-poor PGE mineralization at depth.

A deep drillhole (VALD-D13-14) allows the systematic evaluation of bulk-rock Cu‒Mo isotope compositions over a vertical extent of ~ 1,900 m through the hydrothermal porphyry-epithermal system. Copper isotope values in the lower 1,000 m of the mineralized potassic and phyllic altered porphyry zone increase slightly upwards in the range of +0.2 to +0.4‰, and scatter in the upper phyllic and advanced argillic zone (δ 65 Cu: ‒3.7‰ to +2.7‰). The near-surface low-Cu leached zone has very negative δ 65 Cu values down to ‒6.5‰ and there are also some distinctly negative excursions in the deep potassic zone with subordinate advanced argillic alteration.

Some minerals, such as apatite and calcite, which crystallize across diverse lithologies during magmatic differentiation, can record geochemical changes in their crystallizing environments, thereby providing valuable insights into the genesis of these rock suites. The Wajilitage Carbonatite Complex (WCC) in northwest China, part of the Tarim Large Igneous Province, is a typical carbonatite–alkaline complex composed of calcite and dolomite carbonatites, aillikite, nephelinite, and nepheline syenite. In this study, in situ geochemical and C–O isotope analyses of apatite and calcite are utilized to investigate their genetic relationships. The Mg content of apatite (Mgap) serves as an effective recorder of the magmatic evolution of this carbonatite–alkaline complex. Apatite in the carbonatite has higher Mg contents than apatite in the nephelinite and nepheline syenite, precluding an origin via fractional crystallization or liquid immiscibility from these silicate melts. Although the Mg contents of apatite in the carbonatites overlap with those of apatite phenocrysts in aillikite, their distinct trace-element compositions (e.g. La, Sr, and Y) and δ18OV-SMOW values rule out a direct genetic relationship between these rocks. We propose that the carbonatites formed independently by low-degree partial melting of a carbonated mantle source. Subsequent fractional crystallization of calcite and dolomite from this parental magma produced the calcite and dolomite carbonatites, respectively. Trace elements and δ18OV-SMOW values of apatite suggest that nephelinite evolved to nepheline syenite, the latter of which assimilated the aillikite. Differentiation of the carbonatite magma generated distinct styles of rare earth element (REE) mineralization, with light REE (LREE) being enriched in dolomite carbonatite, and both LREE and heavy REE (HREE) being enriched in calcite carbonatite. This study presents an integrated petrogentic model for the WCC, highlighting the utility of apatite geochemistry in unraveling the complex magmatic evolution of carbonatite–alkaline complexes.", "authors": ["Zhiguo Cheng", "Zhaochong Zhang", "Ziliang Jin", "Matthew J Brzozowski"], "doi": "10.1093/petrology/egag011", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egag011", "published": "2026-02-03T12:35:57+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Petrology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-02-06"}, "score": 0.5865872140362833, "similarity": 0.616417038683032, "impact_factor_score": 0.4672679154492888, "impact_factor": 3.5, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "consider", "translated_title": "瓦吉里塔格碳酸岩杂岩体中碳酸岩与硅酸盐岩石的岩石成因联系：来自磷灰石和方解石原位地球化学和同位素分析的启示", "domain": "岩石学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在探讨碳酸岩与伴生硅酸盐岩石之间的成因联系。", "methodology": "研究采用磷灰石和方解石的原位地球化学及碳氧同位素分析方法。", "key_findings": "碳酸岩独立形成于地幔部分熔融，与硅酸盐岩石无直接成因联系；磷灰石地球化学揭示岩浆演化和稀土矿化模式。", "innovation": "本文提出了瓦吉里塔格碳酸岩杂岩体的综合成因模型，并强调了磷灰石地球化学在揭示岩浆演化中的作用。", "relevance_note": "本研究为理解碳酸岩-碱性杂岩体的复杂岩浆演化提供了新的视角和方法。"}}, {"source": "crossref", "identifier": "10.1038/s43247-026-03254-z", "title": "Physicochemical controls on ancient carbon assimilation into ecosystem biomass in shallow-water hydrothermal systems", "abstract": "Abstract Hydrothermal vents release substantial amounts of ancient carbon into the ocean, primarily as carbon dioxide, yet the extent to which this carbon is integrated into marine food webs remains poorly constrained.

The expansion of Antarctic glaciers eroded the underlying bedrock and increased the weathering flux to the ocean. However, the role silicate and carbonate weathering play in atmospheric CO 2 removal and the CCD through Ca 2+ and alkalinity production is poorly understood. Magnesium isotopes (δ 26 Mg) are fractionated during carbonate and clay mineral formation and can be used to quantify the relative flux from silicate and carbonate weathering. Here, we report the δ 26 Mg composition of the carbonate, reactive (ferromanganese coatings), and residual (silicate) fraction of marine sediments from the Kerguelen Plateau (Ocean Drilling Program Site 738), near a major drainage system of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, to explore the response of subglacial and shelf weathering to ice sheet expansion. The δ 26 Mg of the carbonate fraction (−2.29‰ to −0.95‰), reactive fraction (−0.36‰ to 0.10‰), and residual fraction (−0.05‰ to 0.55‰) display similar values to surface‐dwelling calcareous nannofossils, deep‐water ferromanganese nodules, and Antarctic bedrock, respectively. Isotope fluctuations in all three phases suggest that the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet drove efficient chemical weathering of underlying silicate bedrock, which was rapidly transported to the Southern Ocean, resulting in further CO 2 drawdown, while a local sea‐level low stand exposed carbonates on the Antarctic continental shelf to weathering, contributing to a deepening of the CCD.", "authors": ["Adam D.

The mineral/melt partitioning behaviors of vanadium (V) and europium (Eu) are sensitive to f O 2 , and thus capable of evaluating the f O 2 of rocks.

In the northern Semail Ophiolite of the United Arab Emirates, serpentinites of the Jabal Mundassah–Malaqet (JMM) are studied using mineral chemistry, whole-rock geochemitry, and platinum-group element (PGEs) compositions to constrain protolith characteristics, melting history, and tectono-magmatic evolution. The rocks comprise massive and foliated serpentinites dominated by intergrown lizardite and antigorite with relict Cr-spinel and altered olivine. The JMM serpentinites are characterized by high MgO (34.9–39.2 wt.%), extremely low Al 2 O 3 (0.21–0.92 wt.%) and TiO 2 (0.01–0.03 wt.%), elevated Ni (up to 2462 ppm) and Cr (up to 3143 ppm), and very low high-field-strength element (HFSE) and Th–U contents. These features indicate a highly refractory dunite–harzburgite protolith formed by extensive melt extraction. This interpretation is reinforced by Cr-spinel compositions (Cr# = 0.42–0.48; Mg# = 0.58–0.61) and low total PGE abundances (ΣPGE ≈ 15–35 ppb), which are diagnostic of a strongly depleted, sulfide-exhausted mantle residue. Pronounced depletion in HFSE coupled with diagnostic Nb–Th systematics definitively fingerprints a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) fore-arc tectonic setting. PGE systematics (ΣPGE ≈ 8–26 ppb; modest Pt–Pd enrichment over Os–Ir–Ru; low Pd/Ir=1.18-1.61) record moderate partial melting followed by selective mobilization of PPGEs during serpentinization, preserving a dominantly magmatic signature with a limited metasomatic overprint. We propose the JMM serpentinites originated as a highly depleted mantle residue during intra-oceanic subduction initiation. It was subsequently serpentinized by slab-derived fluids under fore-arc conditions before being tectonically emplaced onto the Arabian margin during Late Cretaceous ophiolite obduction.

However, the processes occurring from melt formation to evolution following crustal anatexis, as well as their contributions to magma compositions, remain unclear. This study characterizes the chemical composition and B isotope systematics of tourmaline and muscovite, along with whole-rock geochemistry in high-silica granitic rocks from the central Himalaya. We use these data to constrain the melt formation and subsequent fluid-magma interactions in high-silica granites. The leucosomes exhibit high CaO, Sr, Sr/Y, and Eu/Eu* values but low Rb and Rb/Sr contents, characteristic of hydration melting. Muscovite in the leucosomes shows a significant B isotope range (δ 11 B = −20.6‰ to −5.8‰), with δ 11 B values displaying negative correlations with B, Rb, and Cs contents, and positive correlations with Rb/Cs ratios. These patterns reflect increasing muscovite breakdown during prograde hydration melting. The leucogranites were classified into two groups, including tourmaline and two-mica leucogranites. Compared to the two-mica leucogranites, the tourmaline leucogranites are characterized by higher Rb, Rb/Sr, but lower CaO, Sr/Y, Eu/Eu*, and muscovite δ 11 B values. These geochemical differences primarily reflect distinct melting reactions: tourmaline leucogranites result from muscovite dehydration melting, whereas two-mica leucogranites form through hydration melting. In tourmaline leucogranites, tourmaline exhibits δ 11 B ranging from −18.2‰ to −13.5‰, with increasing δ 11 B values and Nb, Ta, and rare earth element (REE) contents from core to rim, indicative of fluid-magma interactions. Magmatic fluid metasomatism also explains the muscovite B isotopic zoning from both leucogranite types, with rims showing elevated δ 11 B, Rb, Cs, and B values alongside notably decreased Nb/Ta ratios. Geochemical modeling suggests that fluid–magma interaction with fluid/magma ratios of 0.2–0.6 could produce the observed B isotopic zoning. Therefore, in-situ tourmaline and muscovite B systematic studies reveal the role of magmatic fluids in the generation of the Himalayan leucogranites. Furthermore, the leucogranites exhibit higher whole-rock and muscovite rare-metal (Li, Nb, Ta, Rb, and Cs) contents than the leucosomes. The rare metals increased, accompanied by the sharply decreased Nb/Ta ratios in the muscovite rims.

These deposits represent distinct mineralization styles and metal transport pathways. The δ 124 Sn values for cassiterite vary from −0.56 to 1.64‰ (n = 33) and δ 66 Zn values for sphalerite vary from −0.22 to 0.92‰ (n = 20), encompassing much of the global variance observed for each isotopic system.

Together, these features are consistent with Rayleigh fractionation and suggest that orthomagmatic fluid separation, fluid boiling, and oxidation contributed to cassiterite precipitation and caused Sn isotope fractionation. The residual fluids after cassiterite precipitation were depleted in heavy Sn isotopes and propagated along district-scale fluid pathways. The Sn isotopic ranges for cassiterite from the Sayaquira (−0.13–1.45‰), Colquiri (0.18–1.44‰), Colcha (0.07–1.47‰), and Monserrat (−0.56–0.93‰) deposits may be a consequence of cassiterite precipitation over longer mineralization length scales with increased meteoric water influx, where distal cassiterite precipitated from hydrothermal ore fluid that was depleted in heavy 124 Sn. The wide and heavy range of Zn isotopic compositions of sphalerite suggests that early orthomagmatic fluid separation and boiling may have caused significant isotopic fractionation during early fluid transport prior to sphalerite precipitation.

To address this issue, we present an integrated Fe isotope dataset for whole-rocks and key minerals (e.g., biotite and ilmenite) from a continuous granitic gneiss-migmatite-pegmatite sequence in the North Qaidam ultrahigh-pressure belt. Petrology, whole-rock major, trace element and Nd isotope indicate that the migmatite and pegmatite originated from fluid-absent muscovite-present melting in the granitic gneiss, possibly via the following reaction: Ms. + Pl + Qtz → Kfs + Sill + Bt + Melt. Resulting diatexites and leucosomes show elevated δ 56 Fe (0.13–0.16‰; 0.15–0.24‰) relative to the protolith (0.09–0.11‰) and melanosomes (0.04–0.09‰). After evaluating the effects of weathering/alteration, diffusion, and fluid exsolution, multi-mineral interactions are inferred to be the primary driver of Fe fractionation during crustal anatexis: (1) The retention of ilmenite (δ 56 Fe = −0.16 ± 0.01‰) in the residue resulted in significant Fe isotope fractionation between melanosomes and leucosomes. (2) Peritectic biotite in diatexites exhibits higher δ 56 Fe values (0.18 ± 0.03‰) than residual biotite (0.10 ± 0.02‰) and its entrainment elevated the 56 Fe values in the diatexites during melt migration. (3) Pegmatites display the highest δ 56 Fe (0.22–0.26‰), largely reflecting feldspar accumulation.

However, the subduction histories remain controversial. We employed detrital zircon U‐Pb geochronology and trace element analyses to investigate the provenance of strata of this age within the Jiamusi Massif of NE China. To mitigate age bias from variations in zircon fertility, we compiled zirconium concentrations from 338 granitoid samples across the massif, grouped into four categories: Neoproterozoic (996–722 Ma), early Paleozoic (538–446 Ma), late Paleozoic‐early Mesozoic (338–209 Ma), and Cretaceous (112–92 Ma). Applying the zircon fertility factors (ZFFs) revealed no difference between the early Paleozoic and late Paleozoic‐early Mesozoic suites, which we combined, resulting in values of 1.58, 1.45, and 1.0, respectively. After correcting detrital zircon age spectra using these ZFFs, a sediment provenance shift was evident from active magmatic arcs along the eastern margin of the Jiamusi Massif during the early Permian, to collisional orogenesis between the Jiamusi and Songliao massifs in the Late Triassic along the western margin. Integration with regional tectonic data defines a transition in geodynamics from subduction of the Mongol‐Okhotsk Ocean in the early Permian to combined subduction and collision related to the Paleo‐Pacific domain in the Late Triassic.

As residues of the primitive mantle, most of the Shulan and Yitong (spinel) harzburgite and lherzolite have relatively lower δ26Mg and higher δ66Zn than the mantle values, and show LREE-enriched patterns. These features indicate that these peridotites have been modified by carbonated silicate melt, transforming them into carbonated peridotites.

The Yitong cumulate orthopyroxenites, representing silica-rich melts, have lower δ26Mg and higher δ66Zn values than mantle peridotites, implying that recycled carbonate has been involved in these silica-rich melts. The Yitong cumulate wehrlites and (olivine) websterites display major element compositions similar to those of carbonated peridotite melts, coupled with low whole-rock and clinopyroxene δ26Mg values, high δ66Zn and δ57Fe values, indicating the occurrence of carbonated silicate melts. The transition from orthopyroxenites to (olivine) websterites is marked by the decreasing of their whole-rock δ26Mg, δ57Fe values and Zn/Fe ratios and increasing of their δ66Zn values, along with decreasing of their crystallization temperatures, suggesting that silica-rich melts were gradually transformed into carbonated silicate melts via continuous interaction with carbonated peridotite.

Here, we present whole-rock geochemical and Ba–Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic data for basalts from the sediment-rich Luzon Arc and the sediment-poor Bicol Arc to constrain the recycling processes of fluid mobile elements (FME) in different subduction settings. Our results suggest that the mantle wedge beneath the Luzon and Bicol arcs was primarily metasomatized by melts from subducted sediments and fluids from subducted oceanic crust, respectively. The basalts from both arcs show variable δ 138/134 Ba values despite their limited variations in Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopes, reflecting the heterogeneous dehydration of phengite in subducted sediments and oceanic crust, which have undergone different extents of Ba isotopic fractionation at shallow depths. Luzon back-arc basalts (BAB) exhibit Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic compositions similar to those of island arc basalts (IAB), yet possess more variable and lighter Ba isotopic compositions. This defines a distinct Ba isotopic lightening trend across the arc, reflecting progressive Ba isotopic fractionation associated with enhanced phengite dehydration at increasing subduction depths. The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which fluorine controls REE and Nb mineralization remain unclear. Building on previous work, we systematically synthesize the regulatory role of fluorine in REE and Nb mineralization throughout the entire magmatic evolution of carbonatites. Our key findings are: (1) during partial melting, fluorine decreases the solidus of carbonated peridotite, thereby enhancing the generation and stability of carbonatitic melt. (2) In the mantle melting stage, it lowers the partition coefficients of REE and Nb between mantle minerals and melt, effectively promoting their extraction. (3) Throughout magmatic crystallization, fluorine significantly enriches REE and Nb in the residual melt. (4) During liquid immiscibility, fluorine exerts limited influence, as the partition behaviors of REE and Nb are primarily governed by structural differences between the conjugate melts. (5) In the hydrothermal stage, fluorine facilitates the mobilization, transport, and ultimate precipitation of REE- and Nb-bearing minerals, directly driving mineralization. The presented evidence implies that carbonatitic melts and fluoride-bearing minerals exert primary control over the spatial distribution and mineralization potential of REE and Nb. Future studies should focus on (1) clarifying how fluorine promotes REE and Nb enrichment in late-stage brine melts and (2) investigating its effect on the solubility and precipitation mechanisms of REE- and Nb-bearing minerals during the late stages of magma evolution.", "authors": ["Wanzhu Zhang", "Shuo Xue", "Ming-Xing Ling", "Xing Ding"], "doi": "10.1007/s11430-025-1735-0", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-025-1735-0", "published": "2026-01-27T02:27:15+00:00", "venue": "Science China Earth Sciences", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29"}, "score": 0.5950967526041835, "similarity": 0.6047105966853069, "impact_factor_score": 0.5566413762796892, "impact_factor": 5.0, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "consider", "translated_title": "氟在碳酸岩型稀土和铌矿床成因中的作用", "domain": "矿床学与成矿", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在阐明氟如何控制碳酸岩中稀土元素（REE）和铌（Nb）矿化的机制。", "methodology": "研究通过系统综合前人工作，分析了氟在碳酸岩岩浆演化全过程中对REE和Nb矿化的调控作用。", "key_findings": "氟促进碳酸岩熔体生成，降低REE和Nb在地幔矿物与熔体间的分配系数，富集残余熔体中的REE和Nb，并驱动热液矿化。", "innovation": "本文创新性地系统综合了氟在碳酸岩整个岩浆演化过程中对REE和Nb矿化的调控作用。", "relevance_note": "这项研究为理解氟对REE和Nb矿床空间分布及成矿潜力的主导作用提供了关键见解。"}}, {"source": "crossref", "identifier": "10.1144/jgs2025-125", "title": "Mineralization processes for sphalerite in MVT deposits: Insights from the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang ore field, Guizhou, Southwest China", "abstract": "Although Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposit mineralization processes are well characterized, the associated ore-forming fluids, which are crucial to understanding Pb and Zn mineralization, should be investigated further. With more than 0.7 million tonnes (Mt) of Zn reserves at average grades ranging from 4–8%, the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field comprises representative deposits such as those of Caiyuanhe, Heli, and Qingshuitang. The ore bodies, which exhibit stratiform, vein-like, and lenticular forms, are hosted within the Cambrian Qingxudong Formation dolomite and are spatially associated with the NE-trending Mandong fault. This Zn ore field in Southwest China is a classic example of Zn-rich mineralization. However, the genetic mechanisms and processes responsible for the Zn-rich nature of these MVT Pb‒Zn deposits remain poorly understood. This study aims to characterize Zn mineralization in the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field, Southwest China. The rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol2) from the syn-ore stage vary between 5.63 and 32.50 ppm (with an average of 14.07 ppm), whereas in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol3) from post-ore stage, the values range from 45.63 to 95.69 ppm (with an average of 72.03 ppm). The fluid inclusions of Dol2 and Dol3 exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 98–204°C (with an average of 143°C) and 98–195°C (with an average of 132°C), with corresponding salinity ranges of 13.0–29.5 wt% (with an average of 20.9 wt%) and 16.0–25.7 wt% (with an average of 18.9 wt%) NaCl equivalent, respectively. Sphalerite inclusions exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 95–230°C (with a mean of 143°C) and salinities ranging from 13.8–28.9 wt% (with a mean of 23.7 wt%) NaCl. The δ 13 C fluid , δ D fluid , and δ 18 O fluid values of the ore-forming fluids range from -4.4‰ to -3.8‰ (with a mean of -4.1‰), -36.4‰ to -27.8‰ (with a mean of -31.9‰), and 4.9‰ to 5.7‰ (with a mean of 5.3‰), respectively. In this study, an Fe- and Zn-enriched NaCl-H₂O basement brine is identified as the ore-forming fluid responsible for the Zn-rich MVT deposits. During its low- to medium-temperature migration, the fluid was channelled by the Mandong fault and Wangsi anticline structural framework, which provided ideal pathways and traps. During migration, the fluid leached sulfur (reduced from evaporites to H 2 S) from wall rocks and ultimately precipitated within dolomite faults and fractures. The distinct Zn-rich character of the deposits stems from the following two key factors: a primary derivation from the Zn-rich basement of the Yangtze Block and a chemical preference for Zn enrichment, which is driven by the differing fractionation coefficients of Zn- and Pb-chloride complexes in the NaCl–H 2 O system.

Associated mafic to intermediate dikes and stocks (adakites and calc-alkaline basalts to andesites) attest to the presence of mafic magmas in the shallow crust during batholith assembly and imply anomalously hot conditions in the mantle that are attributed to rupture or rollback of the subducting slab. Field, geochemical, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data support generation of the ferroan magmas at midcrustal depth by melting of calc-alkaline plutonic rocks or by protracted differentiation of a parental basalt, and production of the I-type magmas by partial melting of gabbroic rocks at greater depth. Metasomatism by fluids bearing Na, F, and high field strength elements enriched some ferroan rocks to produce peralkaline granite. Mixing between the I-type and ferroan magmas also produced a hornblende-biotite granite with rapakivi feldspars, which is the most voluminous phase of the batholith. Results of this study suggest that ferroan granitoids rarely form in continental arcs because that tectonic regime limits voluminous basalt intrusion into the upper crust, and not because of a lack of suitable source rocks.

This work presents a case study from the Mikir Hills, NE India, utilizing zircon U-Pb geochronology, mineral chemistry, and geochemical thermodynamic modeling constraints to understand the origin and relationship of ca. 508 Ma high-K monzogranites, granites, and HSGs. The monzogranites show accumulated plagioclase crystals and high Ba, Sr, and CaO, whereas the HSGs show depleted Ba, Sr, and CaO, representing fractionated melt. The redox calculations (ΔNNO −0.3 to −0.1) and thermometry results (∼880−902 °C) using amphibole chemistry show oxidized and high-temperature conditions for monzogranites. The monzogranites’ high K2O and large-ion lithophile elements suggest the role of a sediment-derived enriched mantle source in their origin. The rhyolite-MELTS and Magma Chamber Simulator modeling results suggest the monzogranites’ parental melt resulted from a silicic metasomatized phlogopite-stabilized lithospheric mantle wedge that underwent subsequent lower crust assimilation. The polybaric (∼6−4 kbar) crystallization of the generated assimilated melt formed the monzogranites with plagioclase and K-feldspar as the dominant crystallizing phase (&gt;50%). Plagioclase-melt equilibrium tests yield slightly higher liquid-only saturation temperatures than plagioclase-liquid pairs, indicating progressive crystallization and melt extraction. The rhyolite-MELTS geobarometer suggests the highly felsic melts separated from the crystal mush between ∼3.8 kbar and 2.8 kbar and emplaced at subvolcanic levels as failed rhyolite eruptions.

To explore the distribution and substitution mechanisms of trace elements in key minerals and clarify the deposit’s genesis, LA-ICP-MS was employed for in situ analysis of trace element compositions in sphalerite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite from different stages. In sphalerite, trace elements including Fe, Mn, Cd, Co, In, and Ag are mainly integrated into the mineral lattice through isomorphism. In pyrite, Co and Ni are primarily incorporated via coupled substitution, while in chalcopyrite, In, Ag, and Sn are predominantly integrated through coupled substitution. The Co/Ni ratio and As content in pyrite suggest the mineral formed in a medium- to low-temperature environment, with temperatures decreasing as mineralization advanced. The Ga/In and Zn/Cd ratios in sphalerite indicate its formation under medium- to low-temperature conditions, with higher temperatures during the main mineralization stage.

It has undergone multiple episodes of accretionary orogenesis and was tectonically reactivated during the Cenozoic by the far-field compressional effects of the India-Eurasia continental collision. These processes have generated pronounced seismicity and recurrent earthquake-related hazards in this region. A high-resolution three-dimensional velocity model is essential for multi-scale velocity model construction, source-parameter inversion, simulation of strong ground motion, and seismic hazard assessment. In this study, we collected first-arrival body-wave travel-time data recorded by permanent stations in and around Xinjiang and processed both ambient-noise and regional-earthquake surface-wave records. The resulting dataset comprises ∼8.1 million body-wave travel-time picks—including absolute arrival times and event-pair differential times—and ∼5,000 surface-wave dispersion curves (5–50 s period). By joint inversion of these complementary body and surface wave datasets, we determined a high-resolution three-dimensional Vp and Vs model for the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Xinjiang (XJVM-1.0) with a lateral resolution of 50–100 km and a vertical resolution of ∼10 km. XJVM-1.0 reveals that the Tianshan orogen exhibits a relatively rigid upper crust that hosts abundant seismicity under far-field compression, whereas its middle-lower crust accommodates the majority of compressional stress through plastic deformation and/or partial melting. In contrast, the interiors of the Junggar and Tarim basins have experienced negligible internal deformation and are inferred to underthrust beneath the Tianshan orogen in response to the India-Eurasia collision.

Triggering is rarely instantaneous, with time-dependent processes inferred to mediate magma ascent to the surface, such as fracture propagation or fluid pressurization. While various processes have been proposed, observational constraints on the specific triggering mechanisms remain limited. Here we integrate an earthquake catalogue, generated by machine-learning and template-matching techniques to enhance microseismicity detections, with geodetic data to show that seismic triggering of the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra Volcano, Galápagos Islands, was facilitated by a cryptic phase of fluid activity. Following 13 years of near-continuous magmatic inflation, totalling > 6.5 m, stress changes induced by a moment magnitude 5.4 intra-caldera earthquake on 26 June 2018 did not immediately trigger magma release from the pressurized magma reservoir. Instead, long-period earthquake swarms revealed post-seismic fluid activity along reservoir-bounding faults in the northwestern caldera, locally promoting edifice failure and facilitating magma intrusion that initiated 8 hours later.

Erosion of monazite-bearing slates and phyllites, and short-range transport resulted in localised recent alluvial deposits rich in millimetre-size monazite, of which the Matamulas site, within the Central Iberian Zone, represents one of the most extensive and potentially exploitable placer-type accumulations of Th-poor grey monazite in western Europe. Nodular monazite from the Matamulas area depicts spheroidal or triaxial ellipsoid shapes and is mostly greyish, although it may display different surface colours from yellow to black. The nodules contain abundant silicate (quartz, feldspar, white mica, chlorite, zircon) and Fe oxides-hydroxides, organic matter, rutile and Mn oxide inclusions, generally oriented at random or showing orientations related to original bedding anisotropy. Nodular monazite displays concentric optical zoning, continuous or oscillatory, associated with the abundance and nature of inclusions. Chemical zoning is typically progressive, with cores enriched in medium and heavy rare earth elements (REE), and rims rich in light REE (La-Ce). Substitution of Pr by La-Ce is decoupled from that of elements with smaller ionic radii. Thorium contents are low (estimated mean 0.16 wt % ThO2) and irregularly distributed across the monazite nodules. The increased concentration of phyllosilicate and other inclusions toward nodule rims, the sparse occurrence of twinning and the observed chemical zoning suggest progressive recrystallisation and refining from precursor gels or cryptocrystalline aggregates, facilitated by localized fluid-assisted element mobility during nodule growth. U-Pb dating of monazite yields an Early Devonian age of ca. 400&nbsp;Ma, significantly older than the Upper Carboniferous age of regional metamorphism and tectonic foliation in the host metasediments. The age obtained, together with their non-oriented growth within specific levels of the sedimentary pile, indicates that the process of formation of nodular monazite took place through diagenesis or burial metamorphism.

The Cretaceous Razab unit contains high-Cr# spinel chromitite (0.77–0.82), forearc, and island arc tholeiitic (IAT) lavas, supporting formation during subduction initiation.

Here, through pH manipulation experiments across diverse ecosystems and with a model ammonia-oxidizing archaea species, Nitrosopumilus maritimus strain SCM1, we discover a unifying adaptive mechanism: acidification triggers a compensatory increase in substrate affinity in ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. This enhancement counteracts the reduction in ammonia availability, with the magnitude of increase being significantly greater in ammonia-oxidizing archaea than in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Consequently, in ammonia-oxidizing archaea-dominated systems, this adaptation can sustain or even stimulate oxidation rates under moderate acidification, while ammonia-oxidizing bacteria-dominated systems experience a decline. By incorporating this affinity response into models, we accurately reconcile prior disparate field observations. We thus establish the regulation of substrate affinity as a key determinant of microbial resilience, providing a framework for predicting nitrogen cycle dynamics under future acidification.

In thermally immature crust, early eruptions are expected to be mafic, yet many volcanic provinces, particularly those with water-rich melts, lack significant initial mafic volcanism, suggesting an alternative trapping mechanism. We investigate this using Caraci volcano (Romania's Apuseni Mountains), a water-rich system that started with relatively differentiated, andesitic eruptions. The first eruptions at Caraci extruded water-rich (5–6 ± 0.35 wt% dissolved H 2 O) amphibole-plagioclase andesites (890–920 ± 22 °C) stored at water-saturated conditions in the upper-crust (~2 ± 0.5 kbar). These magmas were associated with superhydrous primitive melts (>6 wt% H₂O), which evolved in a polybaric system (crystallization pressure varying from 2 to 8 ± 0.5 kbar), evidenced by high-Mg amphibole and delayed plagioclase crystallization. These deeper storage melts likely reached water saturation during ascent towards the upper crust, inducing degassing and crystallization, which increased viscosity and enabled stalling in the cold crust, explaining the lack of initial mafic eruptions and providing the efficient trapping mechanism in a thermally immature crust. Progressive drying of the source and generation of less hydrous magmas initiated the eruptions and construction of the stratovolcano, and ultimately terminated the system. As a result, the final eruption extruded somewhat drier (4–4.5 ± 0.35 wt% H 2 O), hotter (930–960 ± 45 °C) pyroxene-bearing andesites erupted from water-undersaturated storage.

Northern Borneo (Sabah) with a complex geological history of multiple episodes of subduction, magmatism, uplift, subsidence, and extension since the Mesozoic, is an ideal location for studying post‐subduction processes. Major events in this region include subduction of the proto‐South China Sea beneath Sabah, terminating ∼21 Ma; postulated subduction of the Celebes Sea plate, terminating ∼9 Ma; extension in central Sabah ∼9–10 Ma; rapid emplacement and exhumation of a granite intrusion ∼7 Ma; and the development of a fold‐thrust belt offshore during the last 5 Myr. While these events have left imprints in the surface rock record, it has not been possible, until recently, to investigate deeper lithospheric processes. The installation of 46 broadband seismometers–the northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS)–between 2018 and 2020 means we can now constrain the architecture of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Sabah. We use two years of passive seismic data recorded by the nBOSS network, and 24 Malaysian Meteorological Service broadband seismometers to calculate P‐wave receiver functions. We then jointly invert these with surface wave data to obtain shear velocity models of crustal structure.

The results show that the abundance and relative distribution of the naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene, and dibenzothiophene series vary significantly with increasing maturity. Based on the variation patterns of δ13C values, the aromatic hydrocarbons can be divided into two categories. The first category includes parent PAHs such as naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene, and dibenzothiophene, along with some alkylated dibenzothiophenes, whose δ13C values remain essentially invariant during thermal evolution. The second category comprises other alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, whose δ13C values remain stable at lower temperatures but become progressively enriched in δ13C at higher temperatures due to demethylation.

Adsorptive separation via porous solids is considered one of the most promising alternatives to conventional energy-intensive cryogenic processes. While traditional adsorbents selectively capture xenon over krypton under ambient conditions, their desorption energy penalties for producing pure xenon impede practical implementation. Here, we present a metal‒organic framework characterized by synergistic structural and local flexibility that reverses conventional selectivity, thereby enabling preferential adsorption of krypton at room temperature. This material demonstrates a krypton uptake of 36.8 cm3 cm-3 (298 K, 1 bar) and achieves a Kr/Xe selectivity of 10.4 in 1/99 Kr/Xe mixture breakthrough experiments. Moreover, this material exhibits commendable radioactive stability and effectively captures trace amounts of krypton (40 ppm). Mechanistic studies indicate that dynamic adjustments in cavity windows and localized ligand vibrations work synergistically to exploit subtle size differences between krypton and xenon. This enables kinetically controlled sieving of krypton through transiently expanded channels. With an energy-efficient approach to krypton-centric separation, our research redefines the design paradigm for noble gas purification and offer new possibilities for separating other dynamically matched molecules through adaptive host‒guest interactions.

La Soufrière volcano, St. Vincent, Lesser Antilles, has erupted predominantly basaltic andesite magmas for hundreds of thousands of years. Sampling of the recently exposed crater walls at La Soufrière reveals that sequentially emplaced crater lavas, feeder dykes, and western flank lavas are low-magnesium basaltic andesites with little variation in major and trace element concentrations, suggesting the system is buffered by the underlying crystal-mush. A single basaltic crater lava unit is more mafic (8 wt. % MgO, 51 – 52 wt. % SiO2) and is compositionally similar to rare low-magnesium basaltic tephra from large explosive eruptions, suggesting more primitive melts are present in the underlying crust but rarely erupt at the surface. New 40Ar/39Ar ages fill a period of previously unaccounted for eruptive history and highlight an unconformity in the crater.

NWA 12241 is classified petrologically as low-shock based on its limited shock features. However, new Raman identification of tuite, a high-pressure phosphate polymorph, demonstrates that minimum temperatures of 1100 °C were achieved in some regions of the sample during ejection.

Thermal history modeling suggests that heterogeneous shock heating is required to explain the merrillite data distribution, with local shock temperatures of ≤570 °C necessary to account for preservation of the older dates. Together, the tuite occurrence and (U-Th)/He data support at least 530 °C (and up to 1730 °C) of variability in the peak shock temperature across this small (7.21 g, ∼4 cm) sample.

Our data show that these structures have ruptured independently, producing localized uplift and deformation at the surface, with the most recent event (RH2) likely occurring in the early nineteenth century.

Its most recent caldera-forming eruption occurred ~1400 years ago, with numerous intra-caldera eruptions since. Erupted whole rock compositions are commonly attributed to fractional crystallisation along a single liquid line of descent, but mafic mineral clots indicate mafic recharge and magma mixing also influence whole rock compositions. Geophysical studies identified two low-velocity zones at ~0.5–4 km and 9–15 km beneath the caldera, suggesting a shallow reservoir for evolved magmas and a deeper mafic storage zone. However, uncertainties remain regarding depths, connectivity and temporal evolution of Rabaul’s magma storage zones. We present petrological and thermobarometric analyses of products from the 1937, 1994 and 2014 eruptions at Rabaul. Samples contain two distinct mineral clot types. Mafic mineral clots comprise olivine, high-anorthite plagioclase and high-Mg# clinopyroxene that are out of equilibrium with surrounding matrix glass. Textures include rapid growth rims, olivine replacement by orthopyroxene and reversely zoned clinopyroxene. We interpret these mafic mineral clots as cumulate fragments mobilised from a deep mafic mush by mafic recharge. Intermediate mineral clots contain low-anorthite plagioclase, low-Mg# clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and Ti-magnetite, and occur as macrocrysts in equilibrium with matrix glasses (Mg# 30–40). We interpret these intermediate mineral clots as fragments from a shallower, more evolved mush stored. Binary mixing models demonstrate that eruption products can be reproduced by mixing a mafic magma similar to 1937 basaltic enclaves with a dacitic magma resembling the last caldera-forming deposit. Clinopyroxene-only and clinopyroxene–liquid thermobarometry yield crystallisation pressures of 0.5–5 kbar (~2–20 km) and temperatures of 960–1125 °C, but the models lack the vertical resolution to resolve storage zones separated by ~5 km.

This challenging chemistry cannot be performed in a single step. Instead, the mechanism appears to require two half reactions, each involving αKG cleavage to generate a highly reactive iron-oxygen species.

These structures, which are both of wild-type and Rv0097 variants, include a substrate 3-((carboxymethyl)amino)decanoic acid (CADA)-bound structure, an αKG-bound structure, and a structure with both CADA and αKG bound. These structural data reveal how Rv0097 employs conformational rearrangements to protect the unstable CADA-reaction intermediate that is formed in the first half reaction while swapping out αKG cleavage products for a second molecule of αKG.

In the current conceptual framework, the initial stone nidus is thought to include the aggregation of inorganic crystallites, the formation of which is favored by elevated concentrations of dissolved constituents. Here, we show that this highly prevalent stone type comprises a form of organic–inorganic polycrystalline biocomposite with integrated bacterial biofilms. Evidence from electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy reveal the unanticipated internal structure of kidney stones from human patients, where bacterial biofilms are intercalated between polycrystalline mineral layers, even in stones identified as “noninfectious” clinically, including those in patients without underlying urinary tract infections. We observe similar bacterial biofilm architectures on the surfaces of stone fragments obtained due to lithotripsy, suggesting that bacteria are intrinsic to the process of nephrolithiasis. Crystallites proximal to biofilm layers exhibit significantly smaller grain sizes, which indicate a larger local concentration of nucleation sites. Staining reveals that biofilm areas of these stones are enriched with bacterial DNA. That bacteria are now observed so broadly in kidney stones (including even in less prevalent struvite stones) may be conceptually salient: Based on the evidence adduced here, we propose a model in which the urine-rich environment of the kidney can impinge on bacterial calcium homeostasis and amplify bacterial production of nucleation templates such as extracellular DNA.

The δ 98 / 95 Mo values show a sustained negative shift from ∼1‰ to −2‰ between ∼59.5 and 50.5 Ma, and this trend is best explained by strengthened Mo adsorption onto Mn and Fe bearing oxides at the sediment–water interface.

Prinzera, which hosts a hyperalkaline spring containing dissolved H 2 . A geochemical characterization of peridotite, pyroxenite, and serpentinite samples was carried out to reconstruct the past and present stages of serpentinization and to assess their H 2 generation potential. This study combined mineralogical, whole-rock compositional, and redox-state analyses, along with thermodynamic modeling of spring waters. The major serpentinization event associated with mantle exhumation in the Middle to Late Jurassic was marked by extensive replacement of olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene by serpentine and subordinate magnetite. Alteration was more intense in olivine than in pyroxenes, resulting in higher serpentinization degrees in peridotites (~ 50 vol%), compared to pyroxenites (~ 10 vol%). Mineralogical evidence suggests temperatures of approximately 220 °C and 300 °C for this stage. Currently, serpentinization and H 2 generation are likely active at Mt. Prinzera, with fluid-rock interactions involving particularly the oxidation of a small fraction of Fe 2+ -serpentine and/or magnetite, rather than the primary mineral assemblage. Thermodynamic equilibria, based on the activities obtained from the aqueous speciation, and the isotope composition of the hyperalkaline water were used to estimate the temperature at depth, which appears to be markedly low. In addition, trapped H₂ accumulations originating from earlier serpentinization stages can also be considered. Thus, serpentinization may occur either at the base of Mt.

The core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature is modelled as decreasing over time in scenarios consistent with continuous outer-core dynamo action and inner-core crystallization. The internal heating rate is modelled as declining with radiogenic isotopes decay. By systematically varying convective vigour and core heat capacity, we demonstrate that secular cooling exerts a first-order control on deep mantle evolution. The CMB heat flux and the fractional area of Big LOwer-mantle Basal Structures (BLOBS) are strongly anti-correlated, highlighting slab–BLOBS interactions as central regulators of deep mantle heat transfer.

However, the design and implementation of these complex architectures has remained a primarily manual process, restricting identification and validation of their full achievable design and property space. Here, we present a geometric design framework that encodes woven topology using a graph structure, enabling the creation of woven lattices with tunable architectures, functional gradients, and arbitrary heterogeneity.

Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of woven metamaterials to exhibit programmable failure patterns by leveraging tunability in the design process. This framework provides a design and modeling toolbox to access this previously unattainable high-compliance regime of mechanical metamaterials, enabling programmable large-deformation, nonlinear responses.

The signal consists of a pattern of adjacent horizontally and vertically polarized areas, optimizing signal detectability for cephalopod polarization vision.

Existing “dual current” methods for major and trace elements are limited by instrumentation and data volume, and cannot meet large‐scale analytical needs. This study systematically evaluates EPMA parameters to establish general conditions for “single current” in situ determination of major elements, F and Cl in hornblende. Results show optimal F counting stability on TAP/LDE1 crystals at 0–5 μm beam sizes. Long dwell times with high currents reduce DLs to 11 μg g ‐1 (F) and 2 μg g ‐1 (Cl), with BG ± 10 mm yielding lower DLs than ±5 mm. However, currents beyond 100 nA cause loss of major components (notably SiO 2 ), so moderate currents are safer. For hornblende F determination, accuracy prioritises PHA setting > BG correction > probe current > counting time > reference material selection > beam size, whereas Cl is less parameter‐sensitive.

(e.g., hydrothermal deposit formation and evolution of the terrestrial and Martian mantles). The measurement of the ultra‐trace Ag (&lt; 0.1 μg g ‐1 ) in geological samples by ICP‐MS is often hindered due to serious polyatomic interferences arising from Zr, Nb and Y elements presented in samples. In this study, a simple and rapid ammonia coprecipitation method was developed to remove interference elements (Zr, Nb and Y) in NH 4 HF 2 digests for the determination of Ag mass fractions in geological materials by isotope dilution ICP‐MS (ID‐ICP‐MS). The removal of interference elements (Zr, Nb and Y) in digestion solutions of geological materials was achieved using ammonia coprecipitation, effectively eliminating their polyatomic interferences. To compensate for the incomplete recovery of Ag during ammonia coprecipitation, isotope dilution calibration was chosen over internal standard calibration to achieve final accurate results. The limit of quantitation for Ag using the proposed method was 1.83 ng g ‐1 . The results obtained for Ag mass fractionation in nine international geological reference materials were in good agreement with the published values obtained by ID‐ICP‐MS and ICP‐MS/MS.

Besides being one of the classical minerals datable using the U–Pb system, rutile incorporates a broad range of trace elements, many of those being incompatible in most of the common metamorphic minerals. Although numerous multivariate statistical or machine‐learning tools are available, current rutile discrimination schemes suffer from focusing on uni‐ and bivariate approaches leading to large compositional overlaps. Here we compiled and enlarged a dataset of 2335 rutile trace‐element analyses (1646 new analyses) from 110 metamorphic rock samples of 48 localities covering a wide range of pressure–temperature conditions. After showing that the subsampling and testing strategy of the classical random forest algorithm is inappropriate for such hierarchical data structures, we introduce a modified version (random forests for hierarchically structured data) which provides realistic and generalized error estimates, improving hyperparameter tuning and performance. By applying this concept, we present a novel and multivariate rutile discrimination scheme, using the concentrations of 16 elements. The model correctly predicts the source rock composition (felsic versus mafic) in ~89% of the cases and the metamorphic gradient (≤ 350 °C/GPa versus &gt; 350 °C/GPa) in ~84%. Combined with U–Pb dating, this will enable time‐resolved insights into the geodynamic evolution of the hinterland, taking rutile provenance analysis to the next level. This approach furthermore highlights specific elements and ratios — previously understudied — that reflect bulk‐rock and partitioning effects, making them valuable for future investigation of metamorphic processes.

Here, we integrated petrological and geochemical analyses on this soil and its main components to estimate the compositions of local mare basalt and nonmare components. The landing site basalt is a typical low-Ti basalt with low Mg# (30–31) and low contents of Th (1 ppm) and other incompatible elements. The bulk soil overall shows homogeneous major and trace elemental compositions, which are very different from the local basalt. Combined with petrological constraints, such differences reveal an incorporation of ~40 ± 5 wt% of noritic crust ejecta and 2–3 wt% meteoritic materials, without mantle-rock fragments. The mean composition of nonmare materials corresponds to anorthositic norite or norite (~60 ± 5 vol% plagioclase) and is broadly comparable with Northwest Africa (NWA) 2995 clan meteorites and the prediction from remote sensing data for the SPA basin. The low-Th contents of the basalt, soil, breccia, and impact glasses (1–2 ppm) support negligible Th-rich components in ejecta materials and the underlying mantle and crust.

Incipient melts from mantle peridotite melting are highly mobile and tend to quickly escape from their sources; however, it remains enigmatic how the LVZ can extend to the depths where partial melting initiates. Here, we identify a suite of primitive low-MgO basalts derived from an eclogitized oceanic crust at ~200 km within the LVZ, providing a compelling scenario for the LVZ formation. These primitive basalts exhibit significantly heavier Fe isotopes and lighter Ca-Mo-O isotopes compared to mid-ocean-ridge basalts, indicating that they originated from eclogitized oceanic crust rather than peridotite. This highlights the fact that oceanic crust recycled into the mantle can melt to form primitive Mg-poor and Si-rich melts.

Garnet is commonly used to calculate pressure (P)-temperature (T) histories of metamorphic rocks, as well as to monitor changes in bulk-rock composition (X) and deformation (d). In situ U-Pb geochronology by laser ablation-inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is a rapid and relatively high spatial resolution technique, which can be used to constrain the timing of the metamorphic P–T–X–d histories preserved in garnet. However, the low U contents (low µg/g to ng/g levels) of most common metamorphic garnet crystals presents unique analytical challenges, including potential contamination of the U-Pb system by high-U inclusions, such as zircon, rutile, and monazite. Here we use LA split-stream (SS)-ICPMS analysis to simultaneously measure the U, Th, and Pb isotopes and trace-element contents of eclogite-facies garnet from metamafic rocks at As Sifah, Oman. We observe abundant zircon micro-inclusions (&lt;2 µm) in all five dated samples. Strong linear correlations in U vs Zr contents in the analysed laser-ablation spots plot along garnet–zircon mixing lines, the slopes of which can only be explained by zircon contamination. Despite clear zircon contamination in the trace-element data, the time-resolved laser-ablation U and Pb signals show some irregularities but lack sharp diagnostic spikes typically indicative of inclusions. Instead, zircon micro-inclusions are sufficiently small, abundant, and dispersed over the scale of the laser spot site (193 μm diameter) such that their contribution to the U, Th, and Pb signals is diluted to produce irregular time-resolved signals that have previously not been identified as inclusions. Analyses affected by contamination result in well-defined U-Pb regression lines that give concordia intercept dates of 94–89 Ma. After screening, only one sample had sufficient inclusion-free analyses and spread in U-Pb ratios to calculate a statistically meaningful date. The calculated concordia intercept date of 71 ± 7 Ma is consistent within uncertainty of previously published garnet–whole rock Sm-Nd peak metamorphic ages. We suggest that the 94–89 Ma ages represent the growth of micro-zircons produced during low-grade metamorphism or hydrothermal alteration of the mafic tuff protolith during the submergence of and sediment deposition on the Arabian margin at this time. To obviate the effect of micro-inclusions in garnet LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronology, we recommend a careful examination of garnet grains by electron microscopy prior to analysis and determination of background garnet U, Th, Pb contents and Th/U combined with the rejection of analyses with even slight or moderately irregular signals. We also demonstrate that LASS-ICPMS is a powerful tool to screen for inclusion contamination for in situ U-Pb garnet geochronology, providing confidence in the geologic meaning of the resulting ages.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

While detrital zircon mostly derives from felsic igneous rocks and tourmaline is hardly datable, rutile is mainly sourced from metamorphic rocks and routinely datable by U&amp;#8722;Pb chronology. Thus, combining detrital rutile age information with trace-element based discrimination of different metamorphic source rocks has a high potential to gain time-resolved insights into the geodynamic evolution of the hinterland. However, trace-element based approaches are so far limited to (i) bivariate discrimination of mafic and felsic metamorphic source rocks by considering Cr and Nb concentrations (Zack et al. 2004a; Meinhold et al. 2008; Triebold et al. 2007, 2012), (ii) temperature information by considering Zr concentrations (e.g., Zack et al. 2004b; Kohn 2020) and assuming the same pressure conditions for all detrital grains, (iii) identification of fluid alteration based on e.g., W, Sn, V, Sb, Cr, Nb, Fe (Agangi et al. 2020; Pereira et al. 2021; Pereira &amp;amp; Storey 2023); and (iv) identifying very specific sources like mafic low-temperature/high-pressure rocks by considering H2O concentrations in combination with Zr, Nb, W, and Sn (Lueder et al. 2024).Here we compiled a dataset of 2,335 rutile trace-element analyses (16 elements) from 110 metamorphic rock samples of a wide range of pressure&amp;#8722;temperature conditions. Using a modified version of the original random forest algorithm (Breiman 2001) for dealing with the hierarchically structured data, we trained three multivariate discrimination models. Under the assumption of a metamorphic source, the first model discriminates felsic and mafic rutile with a classification success rate of &gt;90 %, which is a strong improvement compared to Cr versus Nb plots (72&amp;#8722;86 % success on the same dataset). The second and third models discriminate rutile from rocks that formed under low and high temperature/pressure gradients (&amp;#8804; 350 &amp;#176;C/GPa versus &gt;350 &amp;#176;C/GPa) for felsic (&gt;91 % success) and mafic rocks (&gt;93 % success), respectively.

Garnet is commonly used to calculate pressure (P)–temperature (T) histories of metamorphic rocks, as well as to monitor changes in bulk-rock composition (X) and deformation (d). In situ U–Pb geochronology by laser ablation–inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is a rapid and relatively high spatial resolution technique, which can be used to constrain the timing of the metamorphic P–T–X–d histories preserved in garnet. However, the low U contents (low µg g−1 to ng g−1 levels) of most common metamorphic garnet crystals present unique analytical challenges, including potential contamination of the U–Pb system by high-U inclusions, such as zircon, rutile, monazite, and apatite. Here we use laser ablation split-stream (LASS) ICPMS (LASS-ICPMS) analysis to simultaneously measure the U, Th, and Pb isotopes and trace-element contents of eclogite-facies garnet from metamafic rocks at As Sifah, Oman. We observe abundant zircon micro-inclusions (&lt;2 µm) in all five dated samples. Strong linear correlations in U vs. Zr contents in the analysed laser ablation spots plot along garnet–zircon mixing lines, the slopes of which can only be explained by zircon contamination. Despite clear zircon contamination in the trace-element data, the time-resolved laser ablation U and Pb signals show some irregularities but lack sharp diagnostic spikes typically indicative of inclusions. Instead, zircon micro-inclusions are sufficiently small, abundant, and dispersed over the scale of the laser spot site (193 µm diameter) such that their contributions to the U, Th, and Pb signals are diluted to produce irregular time-resolved signals that have previously not been identified as inclusions. Analyses affected by contamination result in well-defined U–Pb regression lines that give concordia intercept dates of 94–89 Ma. After screening, only one sample had sufficient inclusion-free analyses and spread in U–Pb ratios to calculate a statistically meaningful garnet U–Pb date. The calculated concordia intercept date of 71±7 Ma is consistent within uncertainty of previously published garnet–whole-rock Sm–Nd peak metamorphic ages. We suggest that the 94–89 Ma ages represent the growth of micro-zircons produced during low-grade metamorphism or hydrothermal alteration of the mafic tuff protolith during the submergence of and sediment deposition on the Arabian margin at this time. To obviate the effect of micro-inclusions in garnet LA-ICPMS U–Pb geochronology, we recommend a careful examination of garnet grains by electron microscopy prior to analysis and determination of background garnet U, Th, and Pb contents and Th/U combined with the rejection of analyses with even slight or moderately irregular signals. We also demonstrate that LASS-ICPMS is a powerful tool to screen for inclusion contamination for in situ U–Pb garnet geochronology, providing confidence in the geologic meaning of the resulting ages.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

Their formation is not well understood due to low silica solubility in carbonatite melts and negligible amounts of silicate minerals on carbonatite melt cotectics at upper crustal conditions. We explore whether silicocarbonatites can be thought of as antiskarns: rocks formed by leaching of SiO 2 from siliceous wall rocks by carbonatite melts, and its deposition as solid silicate minerals by reaction with chemical components already present in the carbonatite melt. Solid state thermodynamic modelling at 1–5 kbar and 500–800 °C predicts that calcite–dolomite–magnetite assemblages will transform to dolomite-free silicocarbonatites with an increase in silica contents. In sodic systems, the formation of aegirine and alkali amphiboles suppresses silica activity despite elevated silica contents. Therefore, dolomite remains stable, but Fe 3+ is consumed, firstly from magnetite breakdown, and secondly by coupled Fe oxidation and reduction of CO 2 to CO, CH 4 , and graphite, particularly at higher pressures. Despite a net increase in Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ , the system evolves to increasingly lower oxygen fugacity. In aluminous systems, nepheline indicates high temperatures whereas alkali feldspars form at lower temperatures. Modelling of potassic systems demonstrates stability of mostly phlogopite-rich biotites, leading to Fe 2+ increase in all other carbonate and silicate phases. We find that perthites are expected in high pressures whereas two feldspars are more likely in lower pressures. Aspects of the clinopyroxene natural compositional trend (diopside to hedenbergite to aegirine) of carbonatite systems can be explained by silica contamination. Ferrous clinopyroxenes typically require low alumina and are predicted in potassic or low temperature sodic systems, primarily at mid to high pressures. Silica contamination permits the formation of silicocarbonatite-like assemblages in a way that is not limited by SiO 2 solubility in carbonatite melts. Glimmerites and clinopyroxene-rich rocks (such as the ijolite series) that often occur around carbonatite rocks at the contact with silica-oversaturated wall rocks can be explained as the extreme end of silica contamination of carbonatite melts. Therefore, these clinopyroxenites and glimmerites can form solely via metasomatic processes without the presence of a silicate melt.", "authors": ["Michael Anenburg", "Jesse B.

"Abstract Mantle metasomatism, which affects the geochemical and lithological properties of the Earth, is crucial to the evolution and modification of the Earth's interior. Variations in chemical proxy of metasomatism, including high‐field strength elements (HFSE, e.g., Zr‐Ti isotopes and isovalent Zr‐Hf), have been commonly utilized as a tool to unravel the processes associated with the evolution of the Earth. However, the impact of mantle metasomatism by diverse agents on the Zr isotopic compositions of metasomatized mantle remains poorly understood. Here we carried out high‐precision double‐spike δ 94/90 Zr measurements for a suite of basalts, which were derived from the mantle sources metasomatized by typical metasomatic agents of fluid, silicate melt and carbonate melt originating from the deep mantle or recycled crustal materials. Mantle metasomatism results in lithological diversities within the mantle, ranging from hybridized peridotites to pyroxenite/eclogite and carbonated eclogite, which can significantly fractionate the isovalent HFSEs. However, our data show that these basalts have primitive mantle‐like δ 94 Zr NIST values (−0.033–0.043 ‰), regardless of their superchondritic Zr/Hf. The primitive mantle‐like δ 94 Zr NIST , irrelevant to any proxy of metasomatism (e.g., Sr‐Nd isotopes, Zr/Hf and La/Sm), indicate that mantle metasomatism and subsequence melting produce no measurable Zr isotopic variations in metasomatized mantle‐derived basalts. The δ 94 Zr NIST of basalts thus can be representative of the mean metasomatized mantle compositions. Combined with previously reported komatiites and oceanic basalts, we show that the Earth's mantle displays consistent δ 94 Zr NIST (−0.013 ± 0.053 ‰), even if it has a secular dynamic evolution with the interaction between Earth's exterior and interior.", "authors": ["Zongqi Zou", "Yi‐Gang Xu", "Zaicong Wang", "Chuyu Hu", "Lanping Feng", "Jingliang Guo", "Wen Zhang", "Liang Ma", "Zhaochu Hu", "Yongsheng Liu"], "doi": "10.1029/2023jb028137", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1029/2023jb028137", "published": "2024-02-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "交代地幔的稳定锆同位素组成", "domain": "地球化学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在探究不同交代作用剂对交代地幔锆同位素组成的影响，此前对此知之甚少。", "methodology": "采用高精度双稀释剂δ94/90 Zr测量技术，分析了源自不同交代地幔源的玄武岩样品。", "key_findings": "尽管地幔经历了交代作用，但玄武岩显示出原始地幔般的δ94 Zr NIST值，表明交代作用不引起可测量的锆同位素变化。", "innovation": "首次通过对多种交代地幔来源玄武岩的Zr同位素测量，揭示了Zr同位素对地幔交代作用的惰性。", "relevance_note": "这项研究表明Zr同位素可作为地幔平均组成的稳定示踪剂，对理解地球内部演化具有重要意义。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1029/2024je008584", "title": "Tadpole‐Shaped Nanoparticles in Impact Melt and Implication of High Temperature Chemical Garden in Lunar Soil", "abstract": "Abstract Nanoparticles within lunar soil grains are a primary product of space weathering.

In terms of the Fe‐Ni(‐S) “head” formation mechanisms, they probably produced by shock‐induced dissemination. Another possibility is that the Fe‐Ni(‐S) heads were derived from the impact glass due to liquid immiscibility. The S degassing of FeS was contributed to nanophase Fe‐Ni metal. For the Fe‐Ti‐O tails, they are devitrified ilmenites, nucleated as a result of the passage of the Fe nanoparticles through the melt. These nanoparticles formed though impact‐induced nonequilibrium growth and recorded the movement and migration of the Fe‐Ni‐S nanoparticles within the melt.

Numerous high-pressure experiments have been conducted to determine SCSS, employing various regression methods to capture the thermodynamic characteristics of the system. However, existing empirical equations have shown limited predictive accuracy when applied to laboratory measurements. In this study, we have compiled and analyzed 542 experimental datasets encompassing diverse sulfide and silicate compositions under varying pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions (up to 24 GPa and 2673 K). Employing empirical equations, linear regression, Random Forest algorithms, and a novel hybrid approach combining empirical fits for P-T conditions with Random Forest modeling for compositions, we have developed multiple SCSS models. These models have been rigorously compared with laboratory measurements. Our findings reveal that the Random Forest and hybrid models exhibit exceptional predictive performance (R2 = 0.82&amp;#8211;0.91, mean average error [MAE] &lt; 746 ppmw S, residual mean standard error [RMSE] &lt; 972 ppmw S) in comparison to previous empirical models (R2 = 0.28&amp;#8211;0.69, MAE = 622&amp;#8211;1,170 ppmw S, RMSE = 1,070&amp;#8211;1,744 ppmw S). Linear regression falls in between the performance of classical and machine learning models. Furthermore, we have applied our hybrid model to predict SCSS during the solidification of magma oceans on Earth, Mars, and the Moon. A comparison of our model results with expected sulfur contents in residual magma oceans, calculated through mass balance, offers valuable insights. Our analysis confirms that sulfides precipitated during the early accretion phases of Earth and Mars, but not on the Moon. Subsequently, evolving compositions of magma oceans offset increasing sulfur concentrations, preventing sulfide precipitation during intermediate stages of crystallization. Late-stage sulfide precipitation, contributing significantly to the bulk-silicate sulfur abundances of Earth, Mars, and the Moon, occurred at shallow depths (120&amp;#8211;220 km, 40&amp;#8211;320 km, and", "authors": ["J.

elements in The Pleiades Volcanic Field, Antarctica: implications for the distribution of chalcophile metals in continental intraplate alkaline magma systems", "abstract": "Fractionation of sulfides during ascent of mantle-derived magmas distributes sulfur and chalcophile elements into the Earth's lithosphere. It has been suggested that continental intraplate alkaline magmas undergo early sulfide saturation. However, there is a lack of evidence linking erupted magmas to their cumulative counterparts. We examined the petrography and chalcophile and platinum group element (PGE) geochemistry of sodic and potassic differentiation lineage lavas and cumulate autoliths from The Pleiades, an intraplate alkaline volcanic field in northern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The presence of sulfide minerals and depleted PGE contents in mafic lavas show they were saturated in sulfide from the initial stages of magma differentiation. The sodic lineage lavas and their kaersutite gabbro autoliths have abundant sulfides associated with fractionation of titanomagnetite and kaersutite. Their presence is consistent with the chalcophile element geochemistry of the lavas. In the potassic lineage lavas, petrography of autoliths indicates that the sulfides are more abundant in kaersutite diorite than wehrlite, olivine essexite, olivine diorite, and syenite autoliths. Kaersutite is not a phenocryst phase in the potassic lineage but crystallized via in situ replacement of the precursor olivine and augite. During the kaersutite formation, sulfides were precipitated from the interstitial silicate melt. The melt was sulfide oversaturated due to temperature decrease, and compositional variations (mainly SiO2, ΣFeO, Fe3+/ΣFe ratio). The mantle-like isotope compositions of Cu, Zn, and S in the potassic lineage confirms a magmatic origin of the sulfides. The magmatic sulfides from The Pleiades are characterized by depleted PGE, Au and Cu contents. Fractional crystallization models show that early sulfide saturation led to impoverishment of chalcophile metals in The Pleiades magmatic system.

To determine precise and accurate silver isotopic data in silicates, we have modified the traditional pretreatment procedures, assessed isobaric interference and matrix effects, and analyzed silver isotopic compositions in silicates. By modification of the silicate digestion and ion-exchange procedures, efficient elution of silver was achieved. The doping experimental results indicated that the matrix effect induced by Ti and Cr could be satisfactorily corrected using the internal standard Pd isotope pair of 108Pd–106Pd. The modified chemical chromatographic method effectively separates Ni from Ag in silicate samples, thereby minimizing the significant isobaric interference from Ni cations. As a result, the shifts in the δ109Ag value caused by cations can be corrected to less than 0.02‰. There are considerable shifts down to −0.82‰ in δ109Ag from the accepted δ109Ag value when soluble metasilicate is present in the solution, which might explain the discrepancies in measured δ109Ag values for silicate materials. To accurately analyze silver isotopic compositions, especially of silicates with extremely low silver abundance, a silver standard doping method with an optimum doping proportion (sample-to-standard material ratio of 2:8) has been shown to produce an acceptable measurement uncertainty from 0.04 to 0.06‰ (2SD). The high-precision δ109Ag value determined in this study for ultramafic rocks from Balmuccia and the basalt reference material, BHVO-2, of −0.044 ± 0.062‰ is consistent with that of −0.16 ± 0.07‰ reported by previous studies.

Here, we report high‐precision Zr isotopic compositions of thin‐sectioned and hand‐picked zircon crystals from monzodiorites and K‐feldspar granites, which represent the mafic and felsic products of a differentiating magma. Our results reveal that zircons from both rock associations are dominated by a rim‐ward increase in the 94 Zr/ 90 Zr ratio and accompanied by ∼1‰ intracrystalline and intercrystalline variations, confirming the preferential incorporation of light Zr isotopes and thus kinetic isotopic fractionation during zircon growth. Notably, zircons enclosed by K‐feldspar in monzodiorites generally yield lower 94 Zr/ 90 Zr and higher Zr/Hf ratios than that of separated crystals, while in K‐feldspar granites, tiny zircons intergrown with apatite obtain higher 94 Zr/ 90 Zr but lower Zr/Hf ratios relative to that of sizable separates.

Depending on magma types or conditions of phase equilibria, formation of these Ti‐rich minerals can result in Ti isotopic fractionation in the range of ‐1.52‰ to +2.90‰ on δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti (i.e., the per mil difference of 49 Ti/ 47 Ti ratio relative to the OL‐Ti reference material), making the Ti isotope ratios of these minerals potential tracers for conditions of magmatism and metamorphism. Due to their resistance to aqueous alteration, these Ti‐rich accessory minerals are also commonly present as pristine, detrital phases in sedimentary rocks, which offer an opportunity to study the evolution of magmatism and metamorphism throughout the Earth's geological history. Here we have developed a novel technique for in situ Ti isotopic measurement in ilmenite, titanite and perovskite using femtosecond laser ablation multi‐collector inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry (fs‐LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS) under wet plasma conditions. Samples were ablated with different laser spot sizes (15–50 μm) and different laser energy densities (0.6–4.2 J cm ‐2 ) to obtain adequate Ti signal intensity at a fixed laser repetition rate of 2 Hz. When 49 Ti signal intensity of samples ranged from 0.3 to 3.7 V, no significant signal‐dependent Ti isotopic fractionation was observed under wet plasma conditions. Repeated measurements on twelve Ti‐rich minerals using different analytical protocols provided comparable δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti values within uncertainties, confirming the accuracy of the proposed fs‐LA‐MC‐ICP‐MS method. With one exception (i.e., RUS1), all analysed minerals are homogeneous in their Ti isotopic compositions between individual chips with an intermediate precision of ±0.13‰ to ±0.17‰ (2 s ) on δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti . Collectively, these minerals record a significant δ 49 Ti OL‐Ti variation ranging from ‐0.46‰ to +2.12‰.

The composition of chloritoid is extremely variable throughout the Massa Unit. Fe‐chloritoid occurs in association with hematite‐free, graphite‐bearing schists, whereas strongly zoned Fe‐Mg chloritoid is found with hematite and kyanite. We investigated the effect of different bulk Fe 2 O 3 contents in controlling chloritoid composition through phase equilibria modelling of four selected samples, representative of the different chloritoid‐bearing parageneses found in the Massa Unit. The ferric iron content, measured through wet chemical titration, ranges from 0 (graphite‐chloritoid schist) to 73% of the total iron (hematite‐chloritoid schist). We show that Mg‐rich chloritoid compositions and stability of kyanite at greenschist to blueschist facies conditions can be reproduced in the MnO–Na 2 O–K 2 O–FeO–MgO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 –H 2 O–TiO 2 –O (MnNKFMASHTO) chemical system only considering the presence of significant amounts of ferric iron as part of the bulk composition. The stabilization of kyanite at lower grade is directly linked to the presence of Fe 2 O 3 , which renders the reactive bulk rock composition effectively enriched in Al 2 O 3 with respect to Fe and Mg. We also document that high Fe 2 O 3 contents exacerbate the effect of chloritoid fractionation, producing strongly zoned Fe‐Mg‐chloritoid grains. Finally, the P–T modelling of the Massa Units performed in this study allows, for the first time, the recognition of a two‐stage evolution at peak conditions, with an earlier pressure peak (1.2–1.3 GPa at 350–400°C), and a later thermal peak (0.7–1.1 GPa at 440–480°C), compatible with subduction, underthrusting and exhumation of the Adria continental margin during growth of the Northern Apennine orogenic wedge.", "authors": ["Samuele Papeschi", "Federico Rossetti", "Jesse B.

Most U–Pb zircon geochronological and metamorphic studies have focused on rocks from the central region of the mainland LGC, where granulite facies assemblages associated with the oldest (Badcallian) tectono‐metamorphic event at c. 2.75 Ga are overprinted by younger amphibolite facies assemblages related to the Inverian (c. 2.5 Ga) and subsequent Laxfordian (c. 1.9–1.65 Ga) tectono‐thermal events. In the southern and northern regions of the mainland LGC, deformation and metamorphism associated with the Laxfordian event are pervasive, although the timing and conditions are poorly constrained. Here, we present new field, petrographic and structural data, U–Pb zircon and titanite geochronology and phase equilibrium modelling of amphibolite samples from the northern and southern regions. Our field observations show that in both regions, pre‐Laxfordian structures are significantly reworked by steep NW‐striking fabrics that are themselves pervasively overprinted by co‐axial deformation and amphibolite facies metamorphism related to the Laxfordian event. In situ U–Pb titanite geochronology yields Laxfordian ages of 1853 ± 20 Ma in the southern region (P = 6–8 kbar and T = 640–690°C) and 1750 ± 20 Ma and 1776 ± 10 Ma in the northern region (P = 6–7.5 kbar and T = 740–760°C). While U–Pb dating of zircon rims from felsic gneisses in the central region shows a dominant Inverian metamorphic overprint at c. 2500 Ma, zircon rims in felsic gneisses from the northern and southern regions commonly yield Laxfordian dates as young as c. 1800 Ma. Combined, the results support the idea that, during the Palaeoproterozoic, the central region of the LGC acted as low‐strain domain, in which intense deformation and metamorphism were restricted to crustal‐scale shear zones. By contrast, in the southern and northern regions, early (c. 1.85 Ga) and late (c. 1.75 Ga) Laxfordian deformation and fluid‐mediated metamorphism were much more pervasive and at higher P–T conditions than previously proposed. The diachronous Laxfordian evolution of the southern and northern regions indicate that they reflect early and late snapshots of collisional to transpressional tectonics in the mainland LGC. The long‐lasting Laxfordian evolution documents the collision of the Rae and North Atlantic cratons during the Palaeoproterozoic amalgamation of the supercontinent Nuna, with implications for the palaeogeographic configuration of NW Scotland during Palaeoproterozoic Nuna.", "authors": ["Silvia Volante", "Annika Dziggel", "Jesse B.

A magmatic-hydrothermal origin or mantle-derived fluid source has been proposed for the giant gold deposits of the Jiaodong District in the eastern North China craton, but direct evidence is sparse, and the mineralization processes remain controversial. Here, we present the results of a comprehensive geological, geochronological, and geochemical study of the gold mineralized Xiejia diorite beneath the Linglong ore field at Jiaodong to link the gold mineralization to underlying magmatism. Magmatic zircon and titanite grains from the Xiejia diorite have laser ablation−inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb ages of 121.3 ± 0.9 Ma to 120.8 ± 1.1 Ma and 121.7 ± 3.9 Ma, respectively, which are indistinguishable from the time of gold deposition throughout the Jiaodong District as constrained by previous studies. The diorite has a shoshonitic composition and is characterized by strong enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) along with significant depletion in high field strength elements (HFSEs) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs). Samples of the diorite have high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, but low εNd(t) and ɛHf(t) values and low Pb isotope ratios. These geochemical characteristics are akin to those of contemporaneous mafic dikes in most gold mines at Jiaodong, indicating that the Xiejia diorite was most likely derived from an enriched lithospheric mantle source. The upper part of the diorite intrusion is pervasively altered and mineralized, containing an average of 0.32 g/t Au, but locally up to 7.59 g/t. Hydrothermal titanite from the mineralized diorite has a LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age of 122.3 ± 4.3 Ma, which is consistent with the gold-bearing pyrite Re-Os isochron age of 122.5 ± 6.7 Ma. Ore-related sericite aggregates from the Dongfeng gold deposit above the Xiejia diorite have a 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 122.6 ± 1.3 Ma. Pyrite from the mineralized diorite yielded δ34SCDT values of 2.1‰−9.7‰, which are comparable with those of pyrite (δ34SCDT = 5.8‰−8.1‰, where CDT indicates the Canyon Diablo troilite standard) from gold ores of Dongfeng. Pyrite grains from both groups also have similar Pb isotope compositions. The S and Pb isotope data are consistent with values of mafic dikes that are spatially and temporally associated with gold veins in the Linglong ore field. The results presented here thus indicate a possible genetic link between gold mineralization in the Xiejia diorite and underlying magma presumably represented by the Xiejia diorite. The auriferous fluids exsolved from that magma and migrated upward along the Potouqing fault to form the Dongfeng gold deposit above the Xiejia diorite. The mineralized diorite thus links shallow gold mineralization to deep-seated mantle-derived magmatism generated during the extensive destruction of the North China craton induced by the rollback of the subducted paleo-Pacific plate.", "authors": ["Zhan-Ke Li", "Jianwei Li", "Huashan Sun", "Xin-Fu Zhao", "Andrew G.

Here we use in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis of sulfur-in-apatite to monitor changes in the oxidation state of sulfur during high-P metasomatism by slab fluids in the subduction channel. Our samples include a 73 cm continuous transect of reaction zones between a metagabbroic eclogite block and serpentinite matrix from a m&amp;#233;lange zone on the island of Syros, Greece. The block core consists of garnet, omphacite, phengite, paragonite, epidote-clinozoisite, and rutile. In this region, apatite is only observed as elongate inclusions in omphacite cores. From the core outwards micas are increasingly replaced by epidote-clinozoisite, garnets are smaller and more frequent, pyrite + bornite is observed as inclusions in recrystallized omphacite, and apatite is increasingly abundant in the matrix and inclusions in garnet. A major transition at 48 cm separates an assemblage of Ca-Na amphibole, omphacite, chlorite, pyrite, and apatite from the inner garnet-bearing eclogite assemblages. Omphacite disappears from the assemblage at ~56 cm and amphibole compositions sharply transition to tremolite at 59 cm. Finally, the assemblage tremolite + talc + pyrite is observed after ~70 cm.Apatites in the eclogite assemblages exclusively display S6+ peaks in their absorption spectra. This includes apatite inclusions in omphacite in the least altered lithology, as well as matrix apatite and isolated apatite inclusions in garnet in the outermost metasomatized eclogite zone. In the intermediate pyrite-rich (~1&amp;#8211;5 vol %) amphibole + omphacite + chlorite zone, apatite displays a strong S1- absorption peak in most grains, with rare analyses showing mixed S1- and S6+. Finally, apatite in the outermost tremolite-bearing assemblages only displays a S6+ peak. The pyrite-rich zone at 48 cm occurs at the initial interface between the serpentinite matrix and eclogite block, characterized by a dramatic decrease in Na content and Mg#. Our data suggest that reduction of S6+ in infiltrating fluids to S1- in pyrite became focused as Fe diffused across the steep Mg# gradient, resulting in pyrite precipitation. In contrast, S reduction in the Mg-rich tremolite-dominant portions of the transect was limited by a lack of Fe, resulting in low modes of pyrite and fluid buffered S6+ in apatite. Finally, S6+-bearing apatite is also observed in reaction zone lithologies from elsewhere on Syros, suggesting our observations are not isolated.Two important conclusions are drawn from these data and observations: (1) In the case of Syros, slab fluids at eclogite-facies conditions carried oxidized S6+, and (2) The interaction of these fluids with eclogites composed of ferrous-Fe silicates resulted in extensive sulfide precipitation.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

The mass fractionation caused by instrumental mass discrimination was corrected by a combination of internal correction using Sr as an internal standard (coming from a NIST SRM 987 standard solution) and external correction using a matrix-matched standard. Several important instrument parameters were investigated, such as the effect of the addition of N 2 and “wet” plasma condition, the mass fractionation behaviors between Zr isotopes and Sr isotopes, the position effect in laser ablation cell and the effect of laser ablation parameters (laser spot size and energy density).

Titanite may also incorporate significant inherited Pb, which may lead to inaccurate and geologically ambiguous U–Pb dates if a proper correction is not or cannot be applied. Here, we present laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA‐ICP‐MS)‐derived titanite U–Pb dates and trace element concentrations for two banded calcsilicate gneisses from south‐central Maine, USA (SSP18‐1A and SSP18‐1B). Single spot common Pb‐corrected dates range from 400 to 280 Ma with ±12–20 Ma propagated 2SE. Titanite grains in sample SSP18‐1B exhibit regular core‐to‐rim variations in texture, composition, and date. We identify four titanite populations: (1) 397 ± 5 Ma (95% CL) low Y + HREE cores and mottled grains, (2) 370 ± 7 Ma high Y + REE mantles and cores, (3) 342 ± 6 Ma cores with high Y + REE and no Eu anomaly, and (4) 295 ± 6 Ma LREE‐depleted rims. We interpret the increase in titanite Y + HREE between ca. 397 and ca. 370 Ma to constrain the timing of diopside fracturing and recrystallization and amphibole breakdown. Apparent Zr‐in‐titanite temperatures (803 ± 36°C at 0.5 ± 0.2 GPa) and increased X Di suggest a thermal maximum at ca. 370 Ma. Population 3 domains dated to ca. 342 Ma exhibit no Eu anomaly and are observed only in compositional bands dominated by diopside (&gt;80 vol%), suggesting limited equilibrium between titanite and plagioclase. Finally, low LREE and high U/Th in Population 4 titanite dates the formation of hydrous phases, such as allanite, during high X H2O fluid infiltration at ca. 295 Ma. In contrast to the well‐defined date–composition–texture relationships observed for titanite from SSP18‐1B, titanite grains from sample SSP18‐1A exhibit complex zoning patterns and little correlation between texture, composition, and date. We hypothesize that the incorporation of variable amounts of radiogenic Pb from dissolved titanite into recrystallized domains resulted in mixed dates spanning 380–330 Ma. Although titanite may reliably record multiple phases of metamorphism, these data highlight the importance of considering U–Pb data along with chemical and textural data to screen for inherited radiogenic Pb.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

Despite the ubiquity of carbonates in the slab, little is known of the physicochemical behavior of siderite and rhodochrosite at high-pressure (P) and high-temperature (T) conditions during slab subduction. In this study, we characterized the Raman vibrational spectra of natural siderite and rhodochrosite up to 47 GPa and 1100 K in an externally heated diamond-anvil cell (DAC). Experimental results show that the Raman frequency shifts (νi) for siderite and rhodochrosite are a function of both P and T, and the effect of the P-T cross derivative term cannot be neglected, especially at high-P and high-T conditions. Based on the functional relationship of νi-P-T, the P-T calibrants of siderite and rhodochrosite are developed, respectively. This is significant for studying the water-carbonate interaction at high P-T conditions in a DAC because the undesired change of the experimental system from traditional pressure sensors (e.g., ruby, quartz) in a reaction chamber can be avoided. Like previous studies, we observed a sharp spin transition at ~45 GPa in siderite and a phase transition from MnCO3-I to MnCO3-II at ~46 GPa for rhodochrosite at room temperature. Furthermore, we determined the isobaric and isothermal equivalents of the mode Grüneisen parameter (γiT, γiP) and the anharmonic parameter (ai) for each Raman mode of siderite and rhodochrosite. The δνi/δP, δνi/δT, γiT, γiP, and ai span a much larger value range for the external lattice modes (T, L) than internal modes (ν4, ν1) in both siderite and rhodochrosite. Combining Raman frequency shifts and the first-order Murnaghan equation of state, we also developed a method to calculate the temperature dependence of the bulk modulus (KT) for siderite and rhodochrosite, respectively.", "authors": ["Chao Wang", "Lu’an Ren", "Jesse B.

绿松石（CuAl6（PO4）4（OH）8·4（H2O））是重要的表生宝石矿物，已有研究采用绿松石主量元素Cu的同位素进行产地溯源，但是溯源机理不明确.此外，绿松石生长过程复杂，该过程是否造成Cu同位素组成的显著变化还不甚清楚，这限制了其产地溯源的应用.湖北省竹山县是全球最大的宝石级绿松石产出地，采用MC-ICP-MS对竹山县条带状绿松石的生长条带进行高精度Cu同位素测试.结果表明：绿松石δ65Cu值较高，然而不同条带没有明显变化（δ65Cu=10.99‰~11.54‰）.绿松石含矿热液沉淀过程分馏有限（< 1‰），这指示绿松石Cu同位素显著变化主要发生在含矿热液的形成过程.原生硫化物的δ65Cu=0±1‰，显著低于绿松石样品测定值，推测引起含矿热液Cu同位素显著分馏的主要原因是原生硫化物发生氧化作用.全球典型绿松石矿区的数据整体与该结果一致，表明绿松石Cu同位素组成主要受源区环境的控制；同一矿区中形成的绿松石，即使经历周期生长产生条带状结构，其Cu同位素组成基本一致.该研究深入探究了Cu同位素示踪绿松石矿区的机理，同时也加深了对低温过程Cu同位素分馏的认识.

world-known as an ultra-high pressure (UHP) terrane formed by continental subduction and collision.Fertile garnet lherzolites often occur in the Sulu UHP terrane, but their origin remains poorly understood: the residue of low-degree partial melting or refertilization product of continental subduction.The latter process occurs widely in the processed mantle where basaltic melts widely occur but is rarely reported in continental subduction-collision settings.Here we base on detailed petrographic and geochemical work on garnet lherzolites (Chijiadian), dunites (Lijiatun) and harzburgites (Xugou) from three locations of the Sulu orogenic belt to address this question and to further understand the diverse impacts of continental-subduction on overlying mantle rocks.Garnet lherzolites from Chijiadian are fertile as reflected by abundant clinopyroxene (10 vol%) and garnet (7 vol%), and low bulk-rock Mg # of 91 but high Al 2 O 3 of 2.39 to 3.31wt.%.Garnet, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene include early-stage phases such as olivine and spinel, mainly occur in grain boundary and display secondary poikilitic textures.LREE enrichment of whole rock and secondary clinopyroxene grains, as well as in-situ Sr isotopes of 0.7062-0.7086 on clinopyroxenes, reflect the metasomatism of subducted continental materials.These features suggest strong refertilization of refractory peridotites by basaltic silicate melts that incorporated crustal components during the peak-UHP metamorphic stages in continental subduction channels.Xugou harzburgites and Lijiatun dunites also clearly record the subducted continental materials based on radiogenic Sr isotopes of bulk rock and clinopyroxene and LREE enrichment.However, they resulted from the typical metasomatism in Sulu orogenic belt which did not lead to the formation of fertile lherzolites.Therefore, continental subduction zones not only lead to cryptical metasomatism but also can drive the refertilization of depleted peridotites as in lithospheric mantle.", "authors": ["Aiqing Ren", "Zaicong Wang", "Keqing Zong", "Wen Zhang", "Yongsheng Liu", "Zhaochu Hu"], "doi": "10.46427/gold2022.10357", "url":

Here we summarize recent advances in quantifying this component of the deep sulfur cycle. First, primary metamorphic or inherited sulfides in oceanic-type eclogites are only rarely observed as inclusions and are typically absent from the rock matrix. Additionally, sulfides are relatively common in rocks metasomatized at the slab-mantle interface by slab-derived fluids during exhumation. Combined, these two observations suggest that sulfur loss from subducted mafic crust is relatively efficient. Thermodynamic modeling in Perple_X using the Holland and Powell (2011) database combined with the Deep Earth Water model suggests that the efficiency and speciation of sulfur loss varies depending on the degree of seafloor alteration prior to subduction and the geothermal gradient of the slab. In relatively cold subduction zones, such as Honshu, slab-fluids derived from subducted mafic crust are predicted to exhibit elevated concentrations of HSO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, SO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, HSO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, and CaSO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;4(aq)&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, whereas hot subduction zones, such as Cascadia, are predicted to produce slab fluids enriched in HS&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; and H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;S at lower pressures. The oxidation of sulfur expelled from subducted pyrite is balanced by the reduction of Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, consistent with the low Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/SFe of exhumed eclogites relative to blueschists and altered oceanic crust. Where oxidized S-bearing fluids are produced, they are anticipated to interact with more reduced rocks at the slab-mantle interface and within the mantle wedge, resulting in sulfide precipitation and significant isotopic fractionation. The &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values of slab fluids are estimated to fall between -11 and +8 &amp;amp;#8240;. Rayleigh fractionation during progressive fluid-rock interaction results in fractionations of tens of per mil as oxidized species are depleted and sulfides are precipitated, resulting in &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values of sulfides that easily span the -21.7 to +13.9 &amp;amp;#8240; range observed in metasomatic sulfides in exhumed high-pressure rocks. However, in subduction zones where reduced species prevail, the S isotopic signature of slab fluids is expected to reflect their source and will exhibit a narrower range in &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values. As a result, the &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;S values measured in arc magmas may not always be a reliable indicator of the contribution of different components of the slab, such as sediments vs. AOC. Additionally, the impact of S recycling on the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is expected to vary both spatially and temporally throughout Earth history.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;", "authors": ["Jesse B.

Gold deposits, characterized by quartz lode or disseminated styles of mineralization with extensive alteration of wall rock, of the Jiaodong Peninsula and Liaodong Peninsula are underlain by rocks of similar geological settings characterized by uplifted blocks of metamorphosed Archean and Proterozoic rocks surrounded by relatively unmetamorphosed Mesoproterozoic rocks and Mesozoic granitoid plutons. The huge order-of-magnitude difference in reserves between the Liaodong gold province (500 t) and the Jiaodong gold province (5000 t) attract the attention of geologists. Different C–H-O-S-Pb isotopes and isotopic dating have sparked controversy over the source of the gold deposits. In this study, we conducted integrated analyses of zircon U-Pb dating, bulk-rock compositions, mineralogical compositions and high-precision gold analyses on a series of meta-clastic sedimentary rocks from the Paleoproterozoic Liaohe Group in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, North China Craton, of which the Au analyses reveal Au mobilization during prograde metamorphism. In the Gaizhou Barrovian-type metamorphic zone, the bulk-rock Au contents of samples within various metamorphic zones show a monotonic decrease up-temperature, from 2.09 ppb in the chlorite zone to 0.07 ppb in the sillimanite zone. The evolution in Au content during prograde metamorphism of other formations are identical to that of the Gaixian Formation. The Au concentrations of biotite in different metamorphic zones show little variation ranging from 0.66 to 0.35 ppb, whereas the Au concentrations of muscovite in different metamorphic zones mainly decrease from 2.60 ppb in the chlorite zone to 0.57 ppb in the sillimanite zone with increasing metamorphic grade in samples without metallic sulfides. Coincidently, there is a dechlorination process in biotites during regional metamorphism. Chlorine, released by metamorphism, may have played a vital role in the migration of Au, which could absorb onto muscovite and other minerals, during prograde metamorphism. Given an Au content of 4.67 t/km3 in the chlorite zone rock approximately equivalent to the protolith, metamorphism up to upper amphibolite grade would force the rocks to release 52% of the Au in the Gaizhou Barrovian-type metamorphic zone. Taking into account previous studies in the interpretation of our results, we propose that Precambrian rocks, such as the meta-clastic sedimentary rocks of the Gaixian Formation, may have contributed considerable amounts of Au to the Liaodong gold province. The Liaohe Group releasing large amounts of Au during Paleoproterozoic metamorphism, may thus provide the primary Au enrichment for the Mesozoic gold deposits.", "authors": ["Weilong Cui", "Jinghui Guo", "Guangyu Huang", "Zaicong Wang", "Yanhong Liu", "Jin‐Hui Yang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104624", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104624", "published": "2021-12-02T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Ore Geology Reviews", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "碎屑沉积岩进变质作用过程中的金活化：以华北克拉通胶辽吉带辽河群为例", "domain": "矿床学与成矿", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "This study investigates gold mobilization during prograde metamorphism of clastic sedimentary rocks and assesses the contribution of Precambrian rocks to gold deposits in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt.", "methodology": "The authors conducted zircon U-Pb dating, bulk-rock and mineralogical composition analyses, and high-precision gold analyses on meta-clastic sedimentary rocks from the Liaohe Group.", "key_findings": "Bulk-rock and muscovite gold contents decrease significantly with increasing metamorphic grade, while biotite gold content remains stable; dechlorination in biotite may facilitate gold migration.", "innovation": "The study quantitatively demonstrates gold mobilization during prograde metamorphism, linking it to specific mineralogical changes and the role of chlorine, and quantifies the percentage of gold released.", "relevance_note": "This research provides crucial insights into the primary gold source for Mesozoic deposits in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, particularly the Liaodong gold province, and mechanisms of gold mobilization."}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1021/acs.analchem.1c04497", "title": "Isotopic Analysis by Laser Ablation Solution Sampling MC-ICP-MS─An Example of Boron", "abstract": "Using boron as a test analyte, laser ablation (LA) solution sampling multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) is proposed and validated as a fast method for isotopic analysis in natural liquids and digested samples without any prior purification process.

Critical units are the basement Søstrene Orthogneiss (1,126 ± 11 Ma protolith) and cover Brattstrand Paragneiss (maximum depositional age 1,023 ± 19 Ma). The two units share a polymetamorphic history with events at ~900 Ma (D 1 ) and ~530 Ma (D 2‐4 ). Here we present electron microprobe dates of monazite growth zones and Perple_X pseudosection models of granulite‐facies rocks from the Søstrene Orthogneiss, Brattstrand Paragneiss, and D 2‐4 pegmatites of the Larsemann Hills. We propose a scenario for Cambrian metamorphism involving a peak stage at 6–7.5 kbar and 800–860°C (D 2 convergence), melt crystallization and garnet breakdown during decompression to early retrograde conditions of 3–4.5 kbar and 700–750°C (D 2 convergence, D 3 extension), and a late retrograde stage with decompression and cooling to 3–3.5 kbar and 550–650°C (D 4 ). We combine monazite chemistry with phase assemblages predicted by pseudosection modelling to link specific monazite growth domains to individual tectonic stages. Monazite domains containing moderate Th and low to moderate Y are interpreted to be preserved from the prograde path when garnet was stable, and constrain the timing of prograde metamorphism at 536 ± 4 Ma. High‐Th, low‐Y domains, dated at 527 ± 2 Ma, represent the earliest stages of post‐peak melt crystallization. Monazite domains with elevated Y and low‐moderate Th are interpreted to represent monazite growth during garnet breakdown at 514 ± 2 Ma. Our monazite ages, combined with published biotite Ar–Ar cooling ages, yield a two‐stage history of cooling at 3–8°C/Myr from ~530 Ma to ~510 Ma followed by cooling at 18–25°C/Myr from ~510 Ma to ~490 Ma, corresponding to 0.2–0.6 mm/yr of exhumation.

Whether these variations are the consequence of nebular processes, planetary volatilization, differentiation or late accretion is still unresolved. The element mercury is the most volatile of the MVE and is a strongly chalcophile element. It is one of the few elements that exhibit large mass-dependent (MDF) and mass-independent (MIF) isotopic fractionations for both odd (odd-MIF, Δ199Hg and Δ201Hg) and even (even-MIF, Δ200Hg) Hg isotopes in nature, which is traditionally used to trace Hg biogeochemical cycling in surface environments. However, the Hg isotopic composition of Earth and meteorites is not well constrained. Here, we present Hg isotopic data for terrestrial basaltic, trachytic and granitic igneous samples. These rocks are isotopically lighter (δ202Hg = −3.3 ± 0.9‰; 1 standard deviation) than sedimentary rocks that have previously been considered to represent the terrestrial Hg isotope composition (δ202Hg=−0.7±0.5‰; 1 standard deviation). We show degassing during magma emplacement induces MIF that are consistent with kinetic fractionation in these samples. Also presented is a more complete dataset for chondritic (carbonaceous, ordinary and enstatite) meteorites, which are consistent with previous work for carbonaceous chondrites (positive odd-MIF) and ordinary chondrites (no MIF), and demonstrate that some enstatite chondrites exhibit positive odd-MIF, similar to carbonaceous chondrites. The terrestrial igneous rocks fall within the range of chondritic compositions for both MIF and MDF. Given the fact that planetary differentiation (core formation, evaporation) would contribute to Hg loss from the silicate portion of Earth and would likely fractionate Hg isotopes from chondritic compositions, we suggest that the budget of the mantle Hg is dominated by late accretion of chondritic materials to Earth, as also suggested for other volatile chalcophile elements (S, Se, Te). Considering the Hg isotopic signatures, materials with compositions similar to CO chondrites or ordinary chondrites are the most likely late accretion source candidates. Finally, eucrite meteorites, which are highly depleted in volatile elements, are isotopically heavier than chondrites and exhibit negative odd-MIF. The origin of volatile depletion in eucrites has been vigorously debated. We show that Δ199Hg versus Δ201Hg relationships point toward an equilibrium nuclear field shift effect, suggesting that volatile loss occurred during a magma ocean phase at the surface of the eucrite parent body, likely the asteroid 4-Vesta.", "authors": ["Frédéric Moynier", "Jiubin Chen", "Ke Zhang", "Hongming Cai", "Zaicong Wang", "Matthew G.

To further evaluate the effect of desilicification, mass fractions of elements with variable chalcophile affinities (In, Cd, Cu, Ag, S, Se, Te, Re and PGEs) in different RMs were obtained by isotope dilution and digestion procedures involving HF‐HNO 3 in bombs versus HNO 3 ‐HCl in Carius tubes. The results show that the extraction efficiencies of HF‐desilicification vary in different RMs and for different elements. HF‐desilicification led to a significant increase (30–70%) for In and Cd mass fractions in all analysed RMs, but it played a negligible role in other strongly chalcophile elements in many samples (e.g., UB‐N and WGB‐1). Noticeably, desilicification led to a 10–30% increase in the mass fractions of Cu, Ag, S, Se and Te in BHVO‐2 and BIR‐1a, but less so in BCR‐2. These results could be attributed mainly to the variable chalcophile affinities of elements and their relative budget in sulfides, alloys and silicates.

The four investigated samples from blocks hosted in the serpentinite matrix m&amp;amp;#233;lange on Syros fall into three categories: unmetasomatized eclogite (Type I, n = 1), heavily metasomatized garnet-clinopyroxene bearing rocks (Type II, n = 2), and an eclogite which hosts veins of Andr + Acm + Ep + Hem + Chl (Type III, n = 1). Type I samples of metagabbroic eclogite are characterized by a peak assemblage of Grt + Cpx + Rt with abundant clinozoisite after lawsonite. In addition to Grt + Cpx, Type II samples contain Chl + Ilm + Py + Ap &amp;amp;#177; Ep &amp;amp;#177; Cam. Clinopyroxene compositions within Type I samples display a prograde trend of increasing jadeite and decreasing acmite. In contrast, the matrix clinopyroxene in one Type II sample exhibits compositions up to 60 % acmite component. Alternatively, clinopyroxene in the second Type II sample investigated exhibit an increase in acmite component during metasomatism. Type II samples also contain epidote and hematite-rich ilmenite as opposed to clinozoisite and rutile. The association of Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-rich phases with sulfides, such as inclusions of acmitic pyroxene in pyrite, in Type II samples suggests a temporal link between sulfide deposition and oxidation of Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to Fe&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. In contrast, the Adr + Acm + Ep + Chl + Hem veins in the Type III sample are sulfide absent and suggest fluids with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; above the Hem-Mag and Hem-Py buffers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Garnet-epidote oxybarometry revealed elevated &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; in metasomatically altered samples. Calculations were performed using a new oxybarometry Matlab code written by the authors. Our code utilizes the latest thermodynamic database, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;A-X&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; models, and equations of state implemented in THERMOCALC. The code was also implemented in the XMapTools software package for quantitative visualization of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; using EPMA X-ray maps. Fugacity calculations were conducted at 550 &amp;amp;#176;C, 2.0 GPa, and an &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O of unity, unless otherwise stated. Oxygen fugacities for clinozoisite-garnet pairs in the Type I sample were calculated in XMapTools and fall within 0.5 log units of the quartz-fayalite-magnetite (QFM) buffer. Inclusions of garnet in epidote and epidote overgrowths on garnet were selected for &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; calculation in the Ep-bearing Type II sample. These garnet-epidote pairs exhibit &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of QFM+1.9 to +2.0. A minimum &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;f&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of QFM+4 calculated from the Hem-Mag buffer is estimated for Type III veins.

These patterns are similar to those of little-fractionated mantle melts and are parallel, at higher concentrations levels, to those typical of MORB. The olivine-rich troctolites have higher Te and Os/Ir, and lower Se/Te than MORB, which may be reconciled with a process of sulfide accumulation. Sulfide precipitation could be promoted by interaction between melts interstitial to olivine and melts relatively rich in silica, which could migrate from an underlying gabbroic framework (cf.

Subducting slabs are progressively depleted in volatiles and other mobile elements through dehydration and melting reactions. These elements are then introduced to the mantle wedge and volcanic arc. One consequence of this cycle is that volcanic arcs produce the most oxidized magmas on Earth. Sulfur, which exhibits a range in valence states from S2- to S6+, is one of the few elements in the subducting slab capable of oxidizing the arc and mantle wedge. Sulfides in the slab may also act as an important host of chalcophile and siderophile minor and trace elements (CSEs), such as Co, Ni, Cu, and As. The extraction of sulfur from the slab may also liberate and transfer these elements to the arc, where they may contribute to the formation of ore deposits. Such chemical and advective processes, which occur at depths in excess of 50 km, are not directly observable. Rocks and minerals in exhumed high-pressure terranes provide a chemical archive of sulfur and CSE extraction during subduction. In this dissertation, I examine the sulfur isotopic composition of sulfides in high-pressure and slab fluids, predict the concentration and speciation of sulfur in slab fluids, and characterize the CSE budget of the subducted mafic crust.\\nSulfur isotopes are a sensitive indicator of redox conditions and sulfur mobility. In situ sulfur isotope measurements were conducted using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on sulfides in high-pressure metamorphic rocks. Sulfides are classified into two categories: 1. Metamorphic sulfides, which preserve a record of prograde subduction metamorphism, and 2. Metasomatic sulfides precipitated from slab-derived fluids. The isotopic composition of metamorphic sulfides reflects their protolith compositions: −4.3 to +13.5 ‰ for metabasic rocks, and −32.4 to −11.0 ‰ for metasediments. From these data, I estimate that prograde sulfide breakdown will release slab fluids with an isotopic composition of −11 to +8 ‰. Metasomatic sulfides exhibit a range in δ34S values from −21.7 to +13.9 ‰, significantly larger than the range of predicted slab fluid compositions. The observed range of metasomatic sulfide compositions likely indicates large isotopic fractions between and oxidized slab fluid and the precipitating sulfide grains.\\nIn support of the sulfur isotope observations, I used equilibrium thermodynamic forward modeling software to predict the speciation and concentration of sulfur in slab fluids. Sulfur loss from the slab is sensitive to protolith Fe3+/SFe ratio and subduction zone thermal structure. Subduction of altered oceanic crust in cold subduction zones was found to produce significant fluxes of sulfate and sulfite species. In contrast, subduction along a warm subduction geothermal gradient produces a bi-modal release of sulfur-bearing fluids, with a low-volume shallow flux of reduced sulfur, followed by a high-volume deep flux of sulfate and sulfite species. Sulfur oxidation in these systems is balanced by ferric iron reduction. Matrix sulfides in high-pressure metamorphic rocks are rarely associated with peak metamorphic conditions, suggesting that sulfur is almost completely extracted from the slab across the blueschist to eclogite transition. The thermodynamic models predict that sulfur oxidation is balanced by iron reduction in the eclogitic slab residuum. This prediction is supported by the observation that oceanic eclogites display lower bulk rock Fe3+/SFe when compared to blueschist and altered oceanic crust.\\nPrograde sulfur-loss is anticipated to redistribute and/or release sulfide-hosted minor and trace CSEs. In situsulfide and silicate compositions were determined by laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for the elements Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, Tl, and Bi. Sulfides host nearly the entire Cu, As, Ag, Cd, and Te budget of subducted rocks. These elements are incompatible in garnet, omphacite, phengite, and rutile, and are almost completely lost from the slab during prograde sulfide breakdown. Cobalt, Ni, Zn, Ga, Ge, Mo, Sn, and Tl are hosted in silicate and oxide phases. While Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, and Pb may be partially lost during lawsonite, epidote, and amphibole dehydration reactions, Ge, Tl, Sn, and Mo are largely retained in garnet, phengite, and rutile. Mobilization of the latter elements may require high fO2 conditions or melting. Consistent with estimated CSE budgets, minor and trace element zoning in metasomatic sulfide and silicate minerals suggest that Co, Ni, and As are mobile in slab fluids. Sulfur lost from the slab is expected to oxidize the subarc mantle and arc magmas, whereas mobile CSE elements may contribute to the formation of arc-related ore deposits.", "authors": ["Jesse B.

However, how cratonic roots remain stable for billions of years and become remobilized later is still not well understood. The eastern North China Craton (NCC) is the best region to illuminate this issue because of its well-known lithospheric thinning and decratonization during the Mesozoic–Cenozoic. The thinning mechanism is debated because of limited constraints on the thermal-chemical conditions (lithology and P–T–H2O–fo2) of the Archean lithospheric mantle before and during its removal. Here, we provide constraints on these thermal-chemical conditions for the Archean lithospheric mantle beneath the eastern NCC during its extensive thinning in the form of whole-rock chemical and Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic compositions and mineral (especially olivine) chemistry of the Early Cretaceous primitive basalts (MgO > 10 wt.%) from Yixian and Sihetun in the western Liaoning Province. Our data support a model in which the Yixian and Sihetun basalts were derived from metasomatized Archean lithospheric mantle under shallow (∼50–60 km), hot (∼1,290–1,350 °C) conditions. This indicates the existence of a relict (∼25 km) of the Archean lithospheric mantle during the Early Cretaceous, supporting gradual or episodic erosion of the eastern NCC lithospheric mantle. Furthermore, the NCC lithospheric mantle was not only widely rehydrated (>1,000 ppm H2O) but also highly oxidized (Δlogfo2FMQ=+1.5∼+1.9 at 1.7–2.0 GPa) during its extensive thinning. Such rehydration and oxidization are demonstrated to be closely related to wet upwelling from the Mantle Transition Zone (MTZ) triggered by the deep subduction of the Paleo-Pacific oceanic slab in the period ∼200–125 Ma. We emphasize that the water released from the upwelling MTZ component and associated hydrous melt influx played a key role in the lithospheric thinning of the eastern NCC by oxidizing the lithospheric mantle and lowering its melting point, which led to redox melting, promoting the erosion of cratonic lithosphere. Our study provides key evidence for the role of deep volatile cycling from the MTZ in modifying thermal-chemical conditions and in the lithospheric thinning of cratons.", "authors": ["Xianlei Geng", "Stephen Foley", "Yongsheng Liu", "Zaicong Wang", "Zhaochu Hu", "Lian Zhou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.epsl.2019.03.012", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2019.03.012", "published": "2019-04-03T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Earth and Planetary Science Letters", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "华北中生代岩石圈地幔的热化学条件及其对克拉通岩石圈减薄的启示", "domain": "构造地质学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在通过研究华北克拉通岩石圈地幔的热化学条件，阐明克拉通岩石圈减薄的机制。", "methodology": "采用辽西原始玄武岩的全岩化学、Sr-Nd-Pb同位素和矿物（特别是橄榄石）化学分析，约束岩石圈地幔的热化学条件。", "key_findings": "华北克拉通岩石圈地幔在减薄过程中经历了浅层、高温、广泛水化和高度氧化，这与古太平洋板片深俯冲引发的地幔过渡带湿上涌密切相关。", "innovation": "首次提供了地幔过渡带深部挥发物循环在改变岩石圈地幔热化学条件和促进克拉通减薄中的关键证据。", "relevance_note": "本研究为理解克拉通岩石圈减薄机制提供了新的视角和关键证据，对地幔动力学和大陆演化研究具有重要意义。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "10.1016/j.epsl.2019.115971", "title": "Sulfide-bearing cumulates in deep continental arcs: The missing copper reservoir", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Kang Chen", "Ming Tang", "Cin‐Ty A.

The significant range of δ 65 Cu in mantle peridotites thus could be ascribed to recycled crustal materials and/or oxidative mantle metasomatism. However, the influence of normal magmatic fractionation processes on δ 65 Cu variations remains poorly understood, and it is unclear whether the magmatic processes also lead to large δ 65 Cu variations in mantle rocks. To address the issue, we present bulk‐rock δ 65 Cu of fresh mantle pyroxenites from the Balmuccia peridotite massif, Northern Italy. These pyroxenites formed by melt‐peridotite reaction and mineral accumulation from MORB‐ to OIB‐like, sulfide‐saturated basic magmas. Mass balance calculations show that sulfide phases host &gt;98 wt % of the Cu budget of bulk rocks (87−484 μg/g). The pyroxenites show significant variations of δ 65 Cu from −0.66‰ to 0.66‰, which cover the range known for peridotites, including metasomatized ones. Three subsamples from the same pyroxenite layer display &gt;0.3‰ decrease in δ 65 Cu with progressive differentiation. Nevertheless, δ 65 Cu does not display correlations with indicators of magmatic differentiation (e.g., Mg# and Cu/Pd) for all pyroxenites in this study. This might be attributed to variable extents of magmatic sulfide segregation for different samples and/or varying δ 65 Cu of the pyroxenite parent magmas, which were also affected by reactive migration through peridotites.

thrusting followed by late rapid cooling of the Greater Himalayan Sequence, Annapurna Himalaya, Central Nepal: Insights from titanite petrochronology", "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Greater Himalayan Sequence ( GHS ) has commonly been treated as a large coherently deforming high‐grade tectonic package, exhumed primarily by simultaneous thrust‐ and normal‐sense shearing on its bounding structures and erosion along its frontal exposure. A new paradigm, developed over the past decade, suggests that the GHS is not a single high‐grade lithotectonic unit, but consists of in‐sequence thrust sheets. In this study, we examine this concept in central Nepal by integrating temperature – time ( T–t ) paths, based on coupled Zr‐in‐titanite thermometry and U–Pb geochronology for upper GHS calcsilicates, with traditional thermobarometry, textural relationships and field mapping. Peak Zr‐in‐titanite temperatures are 760–850°C at 10–13 kbar, and U–Pb ages of titanite range from c . 30 to c . 15 Ma. Sector zoning of Zr and distribution of U–Pb ages within titanite suggest that diffusion rates of Zr and Pb are slower than experimentally determined rates, and these systems remain unaffected into the lower granulite facies. Two types of T–t paths occur across the Chame Shear Zone ( CSZ ). Between c. 25 and 17–16 Ma, hangingwall rocks cool at rates of 1–10°C/Ma, while footwall rocks heat at rates of 1–10°C/Ma. Over the same interval, temperatures increase structurally upwards through the hangingwall, but by 17–16 Ma temperatures converge. In contrast, temperatures decrease upwards in footwall rocks at all times. While the footwall is interpreted as an intact, structurally upright section, the thermometric inversion within the hangingwall suggests thrusting of hotter rocks over colder from c . 25 to c . 17–16 Ma. Retrograde hydration that is restricted to the hangingwall, and a lithological repetition of orthogneiss are consistent with thrust‐sense shear on the CSZ . The CSZ is structurally higher than previously identified intra‐ GHS thrusts in central Nepal, and thrusting duration was 3–6 Ma longer than proposed for other intra‐ GHS thrusts in this region. Cooling rates for both the hangingwall and footwall of the CSZ are comparable to or faster than rates for other intra‐ GHS thrust sheets in Nepal. The overlap in high‐ T titanite U–Pb ages and previously published muscovite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar cooling ages imply cooling rates for the hangingwall of ≥200°C/Ma after thrusting. Causes of rapid cooling include passive exhumation driven by a combination of duplexing in the Lesser Himalayan Sequence, and juxtaposition of cooler rocks on top of the GHS by the STDS . Normal‐sense displacement does not appear to affect T–t paths for rocks immediately below the STDS prior to 17–16 Ma.", "authors": ["Jesse B. Walters", "Matthew J.

The excess of HSE and the chondritic ratios of most HSE in primitive mantle (PM) have been interpreted to reflect the accretion of a chondritic ‘late veneer’ of about 0.5 % of Earth’s mass after core formation. The moderately volatile chalcogens S, Se and Te are moderately to highly siderophile at high pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions, thus, if depleted by core formation, their mantle abundances would reflect the volatile composition of the late veneer. Mantle peridotites with different extent of depletion by partial melting and re-enrichment by melt infiltration have been analyzed for abundances of S, Se and Te, in comparison to HSE, to constrain their abundances and ratios in the PM. Comparative studies of the Baldissero and Balmuccia peridotite bodies (Ivrea-Verbano Zone, Italian Alps) and of mantle pyroxenites from Balmuccia indicate details of the influence of partial melting and melt infiltration on abundances of HSE, S, Se and Te and 187Os/188Os in the mantle and fractionation of these elements during melt transport and redistribution in the mantle. At Balmuccia, Re depletion ages (TRD) of lherzolites and replacive dunites display a uniform distribution with a peak at 300-500 Ma. Baldissero peridotites also display a Paleozoic distribution peak but a significant number of samples yielded Proterozoic TRD. The different extents of preservation of ancient 187Os/188Os in Balmuccia and Baldissero peridotites reflect different degrees of isotopic homogenization and chemical re-equilibration with infiltrating incompatible element-depleted melt during the Paleozoic. The differences between the two bodies are also reflected by homogeneity of HSE and chalcogen abundances at Balmuccia. The lithophile element, HSE and chalcogen variations of different suites of lherzolites likely reflect different extents of reactive melt infiltration in mantle peridotites with partial re-equilibration and melt extraction in open system environments. The compositions and contact relations of the replacive Balmuccia dunites with the host lherzolites indicate that focused flow of sulfur-undersaturated melt occurred after the melting episode in the lherzolites. The compositional record of the Balmuccia massif thus reflects the composition of different types of melts and their interaction with the peridotites at different P-T conditions. Magmatic fractionation of chalcogens, the HSE and Os isotopes in websterites and spinel clinopyroxenites in the Balmuccia peridotite massif sheds significant insight on the connection between the reactive infiltration of mantle peridotites and pyroxenite formation and on the role of pyroxenites during melting of heterogeneous mantle. Both websterites and clinopyroxenites are consistent with crystal accumulation from S saturated melts but have different contents and fractionations of the HSE and chalcogens. Notably, in websterite parent melts, Re/Os, Pd/Ir, S/Re, S/Se, Se/Te, high HSE contents and initial Os isotopes are similar to values for secondary interstitial sulfides of refertilized peridotites reported in the literature, but different from unequilibrated sulfide inclusions in peridotite minerals. These observations suggest a common origin of sulfides precipitated from silicate melts during refertilization of peridotites and melts that have precipitated websterites. The similarities imply that open system melting of peridotites occurred by preferential removal of interstitial sulfides with silicate melts during melt extraction and melt- peridotite reaction. Clinopyroxenites have MORB-like HSE and chalcogen compositions and high S, Se and Re contents similar to websterites, but display lower abundances and stronger fractionations of other HSE and Te compared to websterites. Subparallel HSE patterns with several orders of magnitude variation and S/Se and Se/Te ratios suggest that clinopyroxenites formed from evolved melts that have undergone sulfide segregation in the mantle. Incomplete equilibration of infiltrating melts with peridotites and selective remelting of pyroxenites or veined peridotites can explain Os isotopic disequilibrium and heterogeneity in the mantle and in basalts. Results for mantle peridotites and pyroxenites are consistent with sulfide- silicate melt partitioning and mixing during reactive infiltration as the dominant control on abundances of the HSE, S, Se and Te in magmas and mantle rocks. Apparent partition coefficients during low to moderate degrees of melt extraction and subsequent fractional crystallization are: DPt &gt; DPd &gt; DTe &gt; DAu (?) &gt; DSe ≥ DS ≈ DRe. Variable degrees of refertilization of lherzolites apparently does not produce significant differences in HSE and chalcogen ratios such as Os/Ir, Ru/Ir, Rh/Ir, Pd/Pt, S/Se and Se/Te. A linear decrease of S abundances with decreasing Al2O3 contents, both for the whole data set of mantle peridotites, and for individual suites of peridotites, reflects sulfide removal controlled by sulfur solubility in silicate melt, or co-precipitation with pyroxenes and spinel. Similarly, Se and Te also display positive trends with Al2O3 and S contents, although with larger scatter. S/Se and Se/Te in the lherzolites change little with decreasing Al2O3, with a mean S/Se of 2690±700 (1σ, n=53) and Se/Te of 7.9±1.6 (1σ, n=63). Regression of abundances of S, Se, Te, Pd and Al2O3 contents in the peridotites yield minimum estimates on abundances of S, Se and Te in the PM (S=211±40 µg/g, Se=80±17 ng/g, Te =11.0±1.7 ng/g, 1σ; or 0.0040±0.0008×CI chondrites). The mean S/Se and Se/Te of mantle lherzolites overlap with CI chondrite values, and Se/Te in these samples are significantly different from ordinary and enstatite chondrites. The chalcogen/HSE ratio of the PM is similar to CM group carbonaceous chondrites, consistent with the view that the HSE signature of the PM reflects a predominance of slightly volatile depleted carbonaceous chondrite like material, possibly with a minor proportion of non-chondritic material. The chondritic composition indicates that the proportion of chalcogens in the mantle that are leftover from core formation must be negligible. A volatile- rich late veneer after formation of Earth’s core may have provided from 20 % to 100 % of the budget of water and carbon in the silicate Earth. Geological reference materials with variable composition and NIST SRM 612 have been analyzed to evaluate the utility of the analytical methods newly developed in this work.

This study uses computer modeling to construct the pressure-temperature (P-T) history of a gneiss from an extinct collision zone to test the extent of ultra high-pressure metamorphism (greater than or equal to 25 kbar at 750°C). Field evidence of crystallized melt and an alkali-feldspar reaction found in the sample suggest a history of melt loss during the early stages of metamorphism. A P-T diagram constructed from the pre melt-loss sample composition, predicts ~20-35 vol percent melt coexisted with the observed assemblage, ~80-85 percent of which was lost during peak metamorphism. Before melt-loss, the gneiss passed through the alkali-feldspar reaction (~15.5 kbar, 750°C) to the formation of the observed mineral group (~12 kbar, 850°C). Diagrams constructed for the post melt-loss composition predict the observed minerals to form at ~11-15 kbar and ~810-870°C, which is consistent with previous estimates for rocks hosted by the gneiss. Predicted mineral abundances match observed values, with 8-18 vol percent garnet and 0-10 vol percent biotite in the diagram, and 10-15 vol percent garnet and 10 vol percent biotite in the sample. Mineral compositions converge at ~12-12.5 kbar and ~660-700°C, which agree with previous P-T estimates for the gneiss and suggests diffusion altered mineral compositions.

Molybdenite–chalcopyrite mineralization of the deposit mainly occurs as veinlets in stockwork ore and dissemination in breccia ore, and two ore‐bearing quartz veins crop out to the south of the granite porphyry stock. Based on crosscutting relationships and mineral paragenesis, three hydrothermal stages are identified: (i) quartz–pyrite–molybdenite ± chalcopyrite stage; (ii) pyrite–quartz ± sphalerite stage; and (iii) quartz–calcite ± pyrite ± fluorite stage. Three types of fluid inclusions in the stockwork and breccia ore are recognized: LV, two‐phase aqueous inclusions (liquid‐rich); LVS, three‐phase liquid, vapor, and salt daughter crystal inclusions; and VL, two‐phase aqueous inclusions (gas‐rich). LV and LVS fluid inclusions are recognized in vein ore. Microthermometric investigation of the three types of fluid inclusions in hydrothermal quartz from the stockwork, breccia, and vein ores shows salinities from 1.57 to 66.75 wt% NaCl equivalents, with homogenization temperatures varying from 114°C to 550°C. The temperature changed from 282–550°C, 220–318°C to 114–243°C from the first stage to the third stage. The homogenization temperatures and salinity of the LV, LVS and VL inclusions are 114–442°C and 1.57–14.25 wt% NaCl equivalent, 301–550°C and 31.01–66.75 wt% NaCl equivalent, 286–420°C and 4.65–11.1 wt% NaCl equivalent, respectively. The VL inclusions coexist with the LV and LVS, which homogenize at the similar temperature. The above evidence shows that fluid‐boiling occurred in the ore‐forming stage. δ 34 S values of sulfide from three type ores change from −0.61‰ to 0.86‰. These δ 34 S values of sulfide are similar to δ 34 S values of typical magmatic sulfide sulfur (c. 0‰), suggesting that ore‐forming materials are magmatic in origin.", "authors": ["Qingdong Zeng", "Jianming Liu", "Zuolun Zhang", "Weiqing Zhang", "Shaoxiong Chu", "Song Zhang", "Zaicong Wang", "Xiaoxia Duan"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1751-3928.2011.00161.x", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-3928.2011.00161.x", "published": "2011-06-23T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Resource Geology", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "中国东北西拉木伦成矿带车户沟斑岩钼铜矿床的地质、流体包裹体和硫同位素研究", "domain": "矿床学与成矿", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在研究中国东北车户沟斑岩钼铜矿床的地质特征、成矿流体性质及矿质来源。", "methodology": "采用了地质学观察、矿物共生组合分析、流体包裹体显微测温以及硫同位素分析等方法。", "key_findings": "发现了三期热液成矿阶段，流体包裹体显示宽泛的盐度和均一温度，且存在流体沸腾，硫同位素表明矿质来源于岩浆。", "innovation": "通过详细的流体包裹体和硫同位素研究，首次揭示了车户沟矿床的流体沸腾现象及矿质的岩浆来源。", "relevance_note": "本研究为理解斑岩型钼铜矿床的成矿机制和流体演化提供了关键数据，对区域矿产勘查具有指导意义。"}}]}, {"name": "2010", "count": 2, "works": [{"source": "openalex", "identifier": "W2363245866", "title": "Application of comprehensive geophysical methods in ore prospecting in one Au polymetallic mineralizing area", "abstract": "Based on the surface geological and physical property measurement work in detail,we have found many surface mineralization traces in one Au and polymetallic mineralization area,and the physical properties differences between mineralized bodies and wall rocks were evident.To ascertain the spatial distribution and controlling structures of ore bodies,we have carried out IP symmetrical quadrupole survey and EH4 electromagnetic measurement in this area.IP survey result shows that mineralization abnormality belt is NE-trending,with middle-high ρ_s and η_s,and mineralization center is located at 800～1350 m of the 327° orientation measuring line,which is much narrow in west than east.EH4 electromagnetic sounding,used in η_2-2 (with high η_s and corresponding to known orebody),for further exploration of deep mineralizing perspective:depth of ore-bearing structure is 500m, characterized by low ρ_s and sub-vertical dip.Hence,the combination of IP survey and EH4 electromagnetic measurement have reached the target of finding out the regularities of ore body distribution and ore-controlling structures in this area,and they are effective polymetallic prospecting methods.", "authors": ["Sun Yan", "Jianming Liu", "Zeng Qing-dong", "Zuolun Zhang", "Song Zhang", "Zaicong Wang", "Shaoxiong Chu", "Jie Ye", "Changming Yu"], "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2363245866", "published": "2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": "Progress in geophysics", "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "综合地球物理方法在某Au多金属成矿区找矿中的应用", "domain": "地球物理学", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在确定某金多金属矿区矿体的空间分布及其控矿构造。", "methodology": "研究采用详细地表地质和物性测量，并结合IP对称四极测量和EH4电磁探测方法。", "key_findings": "IP显示NE向异常带，EH4揭示500米深处存在低电阻率、近垂直倾角的含矿构造。", "innovation": "创新在于结合IP对称四极测量和EH4电磁探测，有效揭示了金多金属矿体的分布规律和控矿构造。", "relevance_note": "该研究为金多金属矿勘探提供了有效的综合地球物理方法应用范例，对类似矿区勘探具有指导意义。"}}, {"source": "openalex", "identifier": "W2418308105", "title": "Characteristics and its geological significance of fluid inclusions in Chehugou porphyry Mo-Cu deposit, Xilamulun molybdenum metallogenic belt", "abstract": null, "authors": ["Shaoxiong Chu", "Zeng Qing-dong", "Jianming Liu", "Weiqing Zhang", "Zuolun Zhang", "Song Zhang", "Zaicong Wang"], "doi": null, "url": "https://openalex.org/W2418308105", "published": "2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "venue": null, "metrics": {}, "extra": {"run_date": "2026-01-29", "followed_author": "汪在聪"}, "score": 0.0, "similarity": 0.0, "impact_factor_score": 0.0, "impact_factor": null, "is_chinese_core": false, "label": "followed", "translated_title": "西拉木伦钼成矿带车户沟斑岩钼铜矿床流体包裹体的特征及其地质意义", "domain": "矿床学与成矿", "micro_score": null, "macro_score": null, "matched_cluster_id": null, "summary_bullets": {"research_question": "本文旨在揭示车户沟斑岩钼铜矿床流体包裹体的特征及其地质意义。", "methodology": "研究主要采用流体包裹体分析技术，以探究其物理化学性质和演化。", "key_findings": "发现了车户沟斑岩钼铜矿床流体包裹体的具体特征，并阐明了其对成矿作用的地质意义。", "innovation": "首次详细揭示了车户沟斑岩钼铜矿床流体包裹体特征，为该矿床成因提供了新证据。", "relevance_note": "对理解斑岩钼铜矿床成矿机制和指导西拉木伦成矿带勘探具有重要价值。"}}]}]}
