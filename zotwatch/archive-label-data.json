However, it is unclear how carbonated silicate melts are formed. Here, we report whole-rock major and trace element, and Mg-Zn-Fe isotope, and in situ olivine and clinopyroxene Mg isotope data for peridotites and pyroxenites in Cenozoic alkaline basalts from Shulan and Yitong, Northeast China, to reveal the formation mechanisms of carbonated silicate melts. As residues of the primitive mantle, most of the Shulan and Yitong (spinel) harzburgite and lherzolite have relatively lower δ26Mg and higher δ66Zn than the mantle values, and show LREE-enriched patterns. These features indicate that these peridotites have been modified by carbonated silicate melt, transforming them into carbonated peridotites. The Shulan websterites exhibit metasomatic textures, and most of their whole-rock and in situ δ26Mg values are lower than the mantle values, which also supports the presence of a carbonated lithospheric mantle. The Yitong cumulate orthopyroxenites, representing silica-rich melts, have lower δ26Mg and higher δ66Zn values than mantle peridotites, implying that recycled carbonate has been involved in these silica-rich melts. The Yitong cumulate wehrlites and (olivine) websterites display major element compositions similar to those of carbonated peridotite melts, coupled with low whole-rock and clinopyroxene δ26Mg values, high δ66Zn and δ57Fe values, indicating the occurrence of carbonated silicate melts. The transition from orthopyroxenites to (olivine) websterites is marked by the decreasing of their whole-rock δ26Mg, δ57Fe values and Zn/Fe ratios and increasing of their δ66Zn values, along with decreasing of their crystallization temperatures, suggesting that silica-rich melts were gradually transformed into carbonated silicate melts via continuous interaction with carbonated peridotite.

Here, we present whole-rock geochemical and Ba–Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic data for basalts from the sediment-rich Luzon Arc and the sediment-poor Bicol Arc to constrain the recycling processes of fluid mobile elements (FME) in different subduction settings. Our results suggest that the mantle wedge beneath the Luzon and Bicol arcs was primarily metasomatized by melts from subducted sediments and fluids from subducted oceanic crust, respectively. The basalts from both arcs show variable δ 138/134 Ba values despite their limited variations in Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopes, reflecting the heterogeneous dehydration of phengite in subducted sediments and oceanic crust, which have undergone different extents of Ba isotopic fractionation at shallow depths. Luzon back-arc basalts (BAB) exhibit Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotopic compositions similar to those of island arc basalts (IAB), yet possess more variable and lighter Ba isotopic compositions. This defines a distinct Ba isotopic lightening trend across the arc, reflecting progressive Ba isotopic fractionation associated with enhanced phengite dehydration at increasing subduction depths. The Bicol basalts show lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much higher Sr/Zr ratios compared to the Luzon basalts, indicating pervasive fluid infiltration from the subducted oceanic crust into their mantle sources, which promotes the preferential breakdown of lawsonite and results in significant Sr enrichment in the mantle wedge. This observation explains why global arc basalts tend to have higher Sr/Zr ratios with decreasing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Notably, Luzon basalts display Ba/Zr, K/Zr, and Rb/Zr ratios that largely overlap with those of Bicol arc basalts. We propose that subducted oceanic crust plays a role similar to that of subducted sediments in recycling FME, such as K, Rb, and Ba, owing to the buffering effect of phengite.

Both iron-free and iron-bearing bridgmanite develop lattice preferred orientations across this temperature range, with distinct slip systems occurring below and above 1800 kelvin.

It has undergone multiple episodes of accretionary orogenesis and was tectonically reactivated during the Cenozoic by the far-field compressional effects of the India-Eurasia continental collision. These processes have generated pronounced seismicity and recurrent earthquake-related hazards in this region. A high-resolution three-dimensional velocity model is essential for multi-scale velocity model construction, source-parameter inversion, simulation of strong ground motion, and seismic hazard assessment. In this study, we collected first-arrival body-wave travel-time data recorded by permanent stations in and around Xinjiang and processed both ambient-noise and regional-earthquake surface-wave records. The resulting dataset comprises ∼8.1 million body-wave travel-time picks—including absolute arrival times and event-pair differential times—and ∼5,000 surface-wave dispersion curves (5–50 s period). By joint inversion of these complementary body and surface wave datasets, we determined a high-resolution three-dimensional Vp and Vs model for the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Xinjiang (XJVM-1.0) with a lateral resolution of 50–100 km and a vertical resolution of ∼10 km. XJVM-1.0 reveals that the Tianshan orogen exhibits a relatively rigid upper crust that hosts abundant seismicity under far-field compression, whereas its middle-lower crust accommodates the majority of compressional stress through plastic deformation and/or partial melting. In contrast, the interiors of the Junggar and Tarim basins have experienced negligible internal deformation and are inferred to underthrust beneath the Tianshan orogen in response to the India-Eurasia collision.

Here we integrate an earthquake catalogue, generated by machine-learning and template-matching techniques to enhance microseismicity detections, with geodetic data to show that seismic triggering of the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra Volcano, Galápagos Islands, was facilitated by a cryptic phase of fluid activity. Following 13 years of near-continuous magmatic inflation, totalling > 6.5 m, stress changes induced by a moment magnitude 5.4 intra-caldera earthquake on 26 June 2018 did not immediately trigger magma release from the pressurized magma reservoir. Instead, long-period earthquake swarms revealed post-seismic fluid activity along reservoir-bounding faults in the northwestern caldera, locally promoting edifice failure and facilitating magma intrusion that initiated 8 hours later. These observations demonstrate that even when a pressurized reservoir experiences significant stress perturbation, cascading processes could potentially be essential to initiate volcanic eruptions.", "authors": ["Zilin Song", "Andrew F.

Sediments recovered from IODP site U1553 on the southern Campbell Plateau demonstrate evidence of a deeply buried sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ).

Erosion of monazite-bearing slates and phyllites, and short-range transport resulted in localised recent alluvial deposits rich in millimetre-size monazite, of which the Matamulas site, within the Central Iberian Zone, represents one of the most extensive and potentially exploitable placer-type accumulations of Th-poor grey monazite in western Europe. Nodular monazite from the Matamulas area depicts spheroidal or triaxial ellipsoid shapes and is mostly greyish, although it may display different surface colours from yellow to black. The nodules contain abundant silicate (quartz, feldspar, white mica, chlorite, zircon) and Fe oxides-hydroxides, organic matter, rutile and Mn oxide inclusions, generally oriented at random or showing orientations related to original bedding anisotropy. Nodular monazite displays concentric optical zoning, continuous or oscillatory, associated with the abundance and nature of inclusions. Chemical zoning is typically progressive, with cores enriched in medium and heavy rare earth elements (REE), and rims rich in light REE (La-Ce). Substitution of Pr by La-Ce is decoupled from that of elements with smaller ionic radii. Thorium contents are low (estimated mean 0.16 wt % ThO2) and irregularly distributed across the monazite nodules. The increased concentration of phyllosilicate and other inclusions toward nodule rims, the sparse occurrence of twinning and the observed chemical zoning suggest progressive recrystallisation and refining from precursor gels or cryptocrystalline aggregates, facilitated by localized fluid-assisted element mobility during nodule growth. U-Pb dating of monazite yields an Early Devonian age of ca. 400&nbsp;Ma, significantly older than the Upper Carboniferous age of regional metamorphism and tectonic foliation in the host metasediments. The age obtained, together with their non-oriented growth within specific levels of the sedimentary pile, indicates that the process of formation of nodular monazite took place through diagenesis or burial metamorphism.

Here, through pH manipulation experiments across diverse ecosystems and with a model ammonia-oxidizing archaea species, Nitrosopumilus maritimus strain SCM1, we discover a unifying adaptive mechanism: acidification triggers a compensatory increase in substrate affinity in ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. This enhancement counteracts the reduction in ammonia availability, with the magnitude of increase being significantly greater in ammonia-oxidizing archaea than in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Consequently, in ammonia-oxidizing archaea-dominated systems, this adaptation can sustain or even stimulate oxidation rates under moderate acidification, while ammonia-oxidizing bacteria-dominated systems experience a decline. By incorporating this affinity response into models, we accurately reconcile prior disparate field observations. We thus establish the regulation of substrate affinity as a key determinant of microbial resilience, providing a framework for predicting nitrogen cycle dynamics under future acidification.

In thermally immature crust, early eruptions are expected to be mafic, yet many volcanic provinces, particularly those with water-rich melts, lack significant initial mafic volcanism, suggesting an alternative trapping mechanism. We investigate this using Caraci volcano (Romania's Apuseni Mountains), a water-rich system that started with relatively differentiated, andesitic eruptions. The first eruptions at Caraci extruded water-rich (5–6 ± 0.35 wt% dissolved H 2 O) amphibole-plagioclase andesites (890–920 ± 22 °C) stored at water-saturated conditions in the upper-crust (~2 ± 0.5 kbar). These magmas were associated with superhydrous primitive melts (>6 wt% H₂O), which evolved in a polybaric system (crystallization pressure varying from 2 to 8 ± 0.5 kbar), evidenced by high-Mg amphibole and delayed plagioclase crystallization. These deeper storage melts likely reached water saturation during ascent towards the upper crust, inducing degassing and crystallization, which increased viscosity and enabled stalling in the cold crust, explaining the lack of initial mafic eruptions and providing the efficient trapping mechanism in a thermally immature crust. Progressive drying of the source and generation of less hydrous magmas initiated the eruptions and construction of the stratovolcano, and ultimately terminated the system. As a result, the final eruption extruded somewhat drier (4–4.5 ± 0.35 wt% H 2 O), hotter (930–960 ± 45 °C) pyroxene-bearing andesites erupted from water-undersaturated storage.

Northern Borneo (Sabah) with a complex geological history of multiple episodes of subduction, magmatism, uplift, subsidence, and extension since the Mesozoic, is an ideal location for studying post‐subduction processes. Major events in this region include subduction of the proto‐South China Sea beneath Sabah, terminating ∼21 Ma; postulated subduction of the Celebes Sea plate, terminating ∼9 Ma; extension in central Sabah ∼9–10 Ma; rapid emplacement and exhumation of a granite intrusion ∼7 Ma; and the development of a fold‐thrust belt offshore during the last 5 Myr. While these events have left imprints in the surface rock record, it has not been possible, until recently, to investigate deeper lithospheric processes. The installation of 46 broadband seismometers–the northern Borneo Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS)–between 2018 and 2020 means we can now constrain the architecture of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Sabah. We use two years of passive seismic data recorded by the nBOSS network, and 24 Malaysian Meteorological Service broadband seismometers to calculate P‐wave receiver functions. We then jointly invert these with surface wave data to obtain shear velocity models of crustal structure.

The results show that the abundance and relative distribution of the naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene, and dibenzothiophene series vary significantly with increasing maturity. Based on the variation patterns of δ13C values, the aromatic hydrocarbons can be divided into two categories. The first category includes parent PAHs such as naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene, and dibenzothiophene, along with some alkylated dibenzothiophenes, whose δ13C values remain essentially invariant during thermal evolution. The second category comprises other alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, whose δ13C values remain stable at lower temperatures but become progressively enriched in δ13C at higher temperatures due to demethylation.

Here, we present a metal‒organic framework characterized by synergistic structural and local flexibility that reverses conventional selectivity, thereby enabling preferential adsorption of krypton at room temperature. This material demonstrates a krypton uptake of 36.8 cm3 cm-3 (298 K, 1 bar) and achieves a Kr/Xe selectivity of 10.4 in 1/99 Kr/Xe mixture breakthrough experiments. Moreover, this material exhibits commendable radioactive stability and effectively captures trace amounts of krypton (40 ppm).

This enables kinetically controlled sieving of krypton through transiently expanded channels.

This study combined mineralogical, whole-rock compositional, and redox-state analyses, along with thermodynamic modeling of spring waters. The major serpentinization event associated with mantle exhumation in the Middle to Late Jurassic was marked by extensive replacement of olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene by serpentine and subordinate magnetite. Alteration was more intense in olivine than in pyroxenes, resulting in higher serpentinization degrees in peridotites (~ 50 vol%), compared to pyroxenites (~ 10 vol%). Mineralogical evidence suggests temperatures of approximately 220 °C and 300 °C for this stage. Currently, serpentinization and H 2 generation are likely active at Mt. Prinzera, with fluid-rock interactions involving particularly the oxidation of a small fraction of Fe 2+ -serpentine and/or magnetite, rather than the primary mineral assemblage. Thermodynamic equilibria, based on the activities obtained from the aqueous speciation, and the isotope composition of the hyperalkaline water were used to estimate the temperature at depth, which appears to be markedly low. In addition, trapped H₂ accumulations originating from earlier serpentinization stages can also be considered. Thus, serpentinization may occur either at the base of Mt.

We integrate complementary high‐resolution imaging geodesy, teleseismic and strong‐motion waveforms, back‐projection, and finite‐fault inversion to investigate rupture extent, process, and slip evolution. Our results reveal a marked bilateral asymmetry in both rupture extent and speed: it propagated ∼85 km northward at sub‐shear speeds and ∼450 km southward predominantly at supershear speeds (∼6 km/s), punctuated by short sub‐shear segments.

The core-mantle boundary (CMB) temperature is modelled as decreasing over time in scenarios consistent with continuous outer-core dynamo action and inner-core crystallization.

The widespread occurrence of fluorine-bearing minerals (e.g., fluorite, fluorapatite, and bastnäsite) in carbonatites indicates that their parent magmas are rich in fluorine. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which fluorine controls REE and Nb mineralization remain unclear. Building on previous work, we systematically synthesize the regulatory role of fluorine in REE and Nb mineralization throughout the entire magmatic evolution of carbonatites. Our key findings are: (1) during partial melting, fluorine decreases the solidus of carbonated peridotite, thereby enhancing the generation and stability of carbonatitic melt. (2) In the mantle melting stage, it lowers the partition coefficients of REE and Nb between mantle minerals and melt, effectively promoting their extraction. (3) Throughout magmatic crystallization, fluorine significantly enriches REE and Nb in the residual melt. (4) During liquid immiscibility, fluorine exerts limited influence, as the partition behaviors of REE and Nb are primarily governed by structural differences between the conjugate melts. (5) In the hydrothermal stage, fluorine facilitates the mobilization, transport, and ultimate precipitation of REE- and Nb-bearing minerals, directly driving mineralization. The presented evidence implies that carbonatitic melts and fluoride-bearing minerals exert primary control over the spatial distribution and mineralization potential of REE and Nb.

Field, geochemical, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data support generation of the ferroan magmas at midcrustal depth by melting of calc-alkaline plutonic rocks or by protracted differentiation of a parental basalt, and production of the I-type magmas by partial melting of gabbroic rocks at greater depth. Metasomatism by fluids bearing Na, F, and high field strength elements enriched some ferroan rocks to produce peralkaline granite. Mixing between the I-type and ferroan magmas also produced a hornblende-biotite granite with rapakivi feldspars, which is the most voluminous phase of the batholith.

With more than 0.7 million tonnes (Mt) of Zn reserves at average grades ranging from 4–8%, the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field comprises representative deposits such as those of Caiyuanhe, Heli, and Qingshuitang. The ore bodies, which exhibit stratiform, vein-like, and lenticular forms, are hosted within the Cambrian Qingxudong Formation dolomite and are spatially associated with the NE-trending Mandong fault. This Zn ore field in Southwest China is a classic example of Zn-rich mineralization. However, the genetic mechanisms and processes responsible for the Zn-rich nature of these MVT Pb‒Zn deposits remain poorly understood. This study aims to characterize Zn mineralization in the Niujiaotang–Qingshuitang Zn ore field, Southwest China. The rare earth elements (REE) concentrations in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol2) from the syn-ore stage vary between 5.63 and 32.50 ppm (with an average of 14.07 ppm), whereas in hydrothermal dolomite (Dol3) from post-ore stage, the values range from 45.63 to 95.69 ppm (with an average of 72.03 ppm). The fluid inclusions of Dol2 and Dol3 exhibit homogenization temperatures ranging from 98–204°C (with an average of 143°C) and 98–195°C (with an average of 132°C), with corresponding salinity ranges of 13.0–29.5 wt% (with an average of 20.9 wt%) and 16.0–25.7 wt% (with an average of 18.9 wt%) NaCl equivalent, respectively.

During migration, the fluid leached sulfur (reduced from evaporites to H 2 S) from wall rocks and ultimately precipitated within dolomite faults and fractures. The distinct Zn-rich character of the deposits stems from the following two key factors: a primary derivation from the Zn-rich basement of the Yangtze Block and a chemical preference for Zn enrichment, which is driven by the differing fractionation coefficients of Zn- and Pb-chloride complexes in the NaCl–H 2 O system.

Its most recent caldera-forming eruption occurred ~1400 years ago, with numerous intra-caldera eruptions since. Erupted whole rock compositions are commonly attributed to fractional crystallisation along a single liquid line of descent, but mafic mineral clots indicate mafic recharge and magma mixing also influence whole rock compositions. Geophysical studies identified two low-velocity zones at ~0.5–4 km and 9–15 km beneath the caldera, suggesting a shallow reservoir for evolved magmas and a deeper mafic storage zone. However, uncertainties remain regarding depths, connectivity and temporal evolution of Rabaul’s magma storage zones. We present petrological and thermobarometric analyses of products from the 1937, 1994 and 2014 eruptions at Rabaul. Samples contain two distinct mineral clot types. Mafic mineral clots comprise olivine, high-anorthite plagioclase and high-Mg# clinopyroxene that are out of equilibrium with surrounding matrix glass. Textures include rapid growth rims, olivine replacement by orthopyroxene and reversely zoned clinopyroxene. We interpret these mafic mineral clots as cumulate fragments mobilised from a deep mafic mush by mafic recharge. Intermediate mineral clots contain low-anorthite plagioclase, low-Mg# clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and Ti-magnetite, and occur as macrocrysts in equilibrium with matrix glasses (Mg# 30–40). We interpret these intermediate mineral clots as fragments from a shallower, more evolved mush stored. Binary mixing models demonstrate that eruption products can be reproduced by mixing a mafic magma similar to 1937 basaltic enclaves with a dacitic magma resembling the last caldera-forming deposit. Clinopyroxene-only and clinopyroxene–liquid thermobarometry yield crystallisation pressures of 0.5–5 kbar (~2–20 km) and temperatures of 960–1125 °C, but the models lack the vertical resolution to resolve storage zones separated by ~5 km.

Staining reveals that biofilm areas of these stones are enriched with bacterial DNA. That bacteria are now observed so broadly in kidney stones (including even in less prevalent struvite stones) may be conceptually salient: Based on the evidence adduced here, we propose a model in which the urine-rich environment of the kidney can impinge on bacterial calcium homeostasis and amplify bacterial production of nucleation templates such as extracellular DNA. The resultant counterion condensation intrinsic to polyelectrolytes charged beyond the Manning criterion (such as DNA) drastically enhances the probability of heterogeneous nucleation, thereby amplifying calcium oxalate stone formation.", "authors": ["William C.

The emergence of woven lattices—three-dimensional networks of entangled fibers—has introduced a pathway to the largely overlooked compliant and stretchable regime of metamaterials. However, the design and implementation of these complex architectures has remained a primarily manual process, restricting identification and validation of their full achievable design and property space. Here, we present a geometric design framework that encodes woven topology using a graph structure, enabling the creation of woven lattices with tunable architectures, functional gradients, and arbitrary heterogeneity. Through use of microscale in situ tension experiments and computational mechanics models, we reveal highly tunable anisotropic stiffness (varying by over an order of magnitude) and extreme stretchability (up to a stretch of four) within the design space produced by the framework. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of woven metamaterials to exhibit programmable failure patterns by leveraging tunability in the design process. This framework provides a design and modeling toolbox to access this previously unattainable high-compliance regime of mechanical metamaterials, enabling programmable large-deformation, nonlinear responses.

While numerous studies have explored the mechanisms and functions of body coloration as a sexual signal, the role of another essential property of light—polarization—remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the question of whether and how polarization signals achieve high conspicuousness under sexual selection, including their visibility and associated behavioral and morphological adaptations, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we identified a strikingly conspicuous polarization signal used specifically during courtship in the cuttlefish Doratosepion andreanum and investigated the underlying optical mechanism. The signal consists of a pattern of adjacent horizontally and vertically polarized areas, optimizing signal detectability for cephalopod polarization vision. This pattern is generated by reflective cells called iridophores and transparent muscle: light becomes horizontally polarized when reflected by iridophores, and its angle of polarization is then rotated to vertical when transmitted through a birefringent muscle layer.

In many cold regions, frozen ground is common, yet its impact on SWI remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the formation of frozen ground alters salinity distribution in coastal unconfined aquifers, based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Under steady‐state conditions with subzero ground temperature, frozen ground creates a confined flow path between itself and the saltwater wedge. This configuration accelerates terrestrial groundwater flow and induces a pronounced seaward retreat of the saltwater wedge. Moreover, lower ground surface and groundwater temperatures enhance this effect by promoting frozen ground formation.

Here, inspired by natural metabolite sensing/signaling system, we develop a DNA origami-based ATP-sensing nanodevice (ND) for fine-tuning purinergic signaling and immune homeostasis. This ND composes a tubular DNA origami equipped with ATP sensors and the catalytic subunits (ENPP1-CD73 pairs), which can sense high levels of exATP and then expose the catalytic subunits for metabolizing exATP to adenosine, thereby driving an immune switch from exATP-mediated proinflammatory signals to adenosine-mediated immunosuppressive signals. Further surface displaying of ND on the monocytes (ND@Monos) enables its active inflamed site-targeting to restore immunometabolic hemostasis and reduce inflammation in diverse models in vivo. This study highlights that design of metabolite-sensing NDs is a promising strategy for controlling the homeostasis of cell metabolism and the immune response.

This study systematically evaluates EPMA parameters to establish general conditions for “single current” in situ determination of major elements, F and Cl in hornblende. Results show optimal F counting stability on TAP/LDE1 crystals at 0–5 μm beam sizes. Long dwell times with high currents reduce DLs to 11 μg g ‐1 (F) and 2 μg g ‐1 (Cl), with BG ± 10 mm yielding lower DLs than ±5 mm. However, currents beyond 100 nA cause loss of major components (notably SiO 2 ), so moderate currents are safer. For hornblende F determination, accuracy prioritises PHA setting > BG correction > probe current > counting time > reference material selection > beam size, whereas Cl is less parameter‐sensitive.
